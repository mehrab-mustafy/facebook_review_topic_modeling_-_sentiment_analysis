"Ridiculous update -- the Back button no longer works. You have to use the one within Facebook. I have no idea what possible good this does unless it improves tracking. Also, for several months now, they changed a setting. It used to be you could open all links in an external browser. Now it doesn't work for that -- it says it only does that for links set in Messages. Annoying and ridiculous.",2,bad
"Since the most recent update, the backup arrow has been not working on my phone when i'm using facebook. I have to use the back arrow on the facebook app to be able to go back to the previous page. It is super annoying. And I really wish that they would fix it. Plus not to mention, the amount of ads added to the videos. I can't even watch a video without an ad popping up. I'm beginning to lose my like for facebook. Please fix all issues. Thanks.",3,bad
"This app is so unreliable. This has happened way too many times. After getting new updates, the app seems to forget to play the videos automatically. This is very frustrating. I have tried multiple times to get it to do it automatically, but I have not been able to accomplish anything with it. I am a person who relies on videos a whole lot. I wish that Facebook would address their updates adequately.",1,bad
"Edit: Cool, so instead of fixing the existing back button issue, you actually just made it work even less than it did before. Thanks a lot. When I press the back button, I want to EXIT THE APP. I don't want you to scroll to the top and load more garbage to waste my time on. I used to just shrug it off, but recently, spamming the back button no longer (eventually) closes it; it just stays open.",1,bad
"Y'all took away my ability to use my phone's back button at the bottom of my screen, and it's VERY annoying. I've been spending even less time on here now. This app has so, so, so many ads! Just a crazy number of ads! I used to like watching videos on here, but now there are 2-4 ads per video instead of just 1, maybe 2. It's ridiculous. They aren't even good ads. It's usually just the same stuff over and over again.",1,bad
"FB does a lot of things great and is user friendly. Posts, pictures, edits, shares, finding friends -- all easy. And lots to do: posts, groups, marketplace. There is one irritation: when I get a group notification highlighting a particular post and click on that, it just takes me to the group, not the post. Sometimes it's 2-4 down from the top, sometimes I give up before I find it. Everything else is pretty good. Watch out for scammers, but that's on us individually.",4,good
"This app was already terrible to begin with, but it functioned at least. Over time, the updates kept getting worse. We got blasted with ads and unrelated news that we didn't sign up for. Now let me mention the crazy amount of slow down and freezes it does now for random reasons. Apparently, now something as simple as the back button doesn't work properly on Android devices...",1,bad
"Unsure if it was on purpose, don't like the fact that Facebook has now taken away a feature on my actual phone (the back button). Very weird, not sure how that's efficient in the slightest. The memes about it on the site have been great, though. Also, I could deal with the number of ads on the regular newsfeed, but now that it's added them on to people's own profiles, it's way too much. A site should not have this many ads for how much of our data you sell already.",1,bad
"Back button stopped working in certain screens and I've been flooded with ads for knock off Chinese knives. The option to hide, block, and report them has disappeared as well. No matter how many times I hit the ""see less of this"" button they continue to show up CONSTANTLY. What's the point of giving me options to do things if they do not work?!",1,bad
"""Improvements"" are actually just power plays. Every time Facebook updates or changes their algorithm, the platform gets worse for users. Case in point, the latest ""improvement"" which is blocking Android users the ability to use their phone's back button at the bottom right of the screen in favor of the Fb back button at the top left of the screen. I don't know about you, but I hold my phone from the bottom, and a top-docked back button is maddening. Quit messing with stuff! Leave it alone!",1,bad
"For the last year or so, when I'm scrolling through my memories and there's one that shows that I uploaded pictures into a particular album, it'll show a preview of the pictures, but I can't view the individual pictures. When I click on any of them, I get a blank screen that states, ""something went wrong."" I've reported the issue and included screen shots numerous times since it started and they still haven't fixed it.",1,bad
"FIX THE BACK BUTTON!! FIX THE BACK BUTTON!! FIX THE BACK BUTTON! I've started closing the app every time I can't use the back button. I seem to be using Facebook less and less because it's become more aggravating than it's worth. Oh, and forcing me to watch a video and not be able to back it up with a slide bar? I just wind up closing the app. again.",2,bad
"I hate that the notifications come up totally out of order!! Also when I'm trying to scroll through many of them, it will get part of the way down, and then it'll jump back up to the top. And I miss so many of my notifications. The system is terrible. Speaking of notifications, why do the read and not read colors have to be so similar?? Navy blue or black? Really? Can we make them easier to distinguish??",3,bad
"So as reviews say, the back button broke. Chalk that to minor inconvenience, but it's part of a bigger problem. The interface broke compared to a year ago. Across time, more features left, but pretend they're there. You can't share to w business page anymore unless logged in as the page. It gives you the option but has given an error for a while. That means losing the place you were at, because you can't put the link URL INTO FB to get to it. They should allow you to comment AS your profile.",2,bad
"The major annoyance I deal with is the back function on the phone no longer controls the app. I have to use the arrow in the upper left corner all the time. The next major annoyance is that in the recent app section there will be multiple instances of Facebook open. Third, there so it's very bloated and uses a ton of data. Overall a terrible app.",2,bad
"3 problems that just started recently: 1. The type bar under posts defaults to ""send message"" instead of ""comment"" which was much more useful. 2. My android back button on the bottom right doesn't work to go back a screen within Facebook, I have to use the top left arrow which is much less convenient. 3. I got a message saying I'd ""violated community guidelines"" and wouldn't be able to use the platform fully for 24 hours. No explanation so I have no idea what I did.",2,bad
"The standard Android ""back"" gesture (swipe from side of the screen) no longer consistently works to go back. Instead you frequently have to reach across the screen to the app's built in back button. With phones being as big as they are these days, this either requires two handed operation or adjusting your phone's grip just to do what a simple swipe from the side is supposed to accomplish. Fix this.",1,bad
I have a Pixel 5. All of a sudden while in the fb My navigation keys no longer work while viewing specific types of posts or checking notifications. So basically the back arrow that I have at the bottom of my screen to navigate through backing out of applications or screens. No longer works well looking at specific content on Facebook. This just started happening yesterday. It's incredibly annoying and inconvenient. Fix it please.,2,bad
Facebook app is stuck on moving. I have a notification that won't go away stating the system UI is moving Facebook. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and the notification came back. I keep the app on the Micro SD card as it is a large app. It keeps happening every few months. 10/2/23 Links on posts will no longer open within app or outside browser. checked and unchecked in media settings. Not being able to open links is annoying. Whats the point of sharing if you can't open it.,1,bad
"Mercy! STOP with the updates already. Now when I use the app it is slower and has to do a double flash to load. PLEASE leave well enough alone. When I try to upload anything I get errors. When I try to share anything, I get errors. Trying to use my ""back"" button is gone, which is annoying. At this point, one more lousy update and I delete facebook permanently from my phone. 😡",1,bad
"Thanks for uploading a terrible update... the back button no longer works, I can't click on someone's profile and message them either. I have to go the long way around through messenger search. Several other issues, not going to list them all because it's not like you'll fix anything unless you feel like it. Every update is worse than the last.",1,bad
"No back button? All the regular updates can get annoying because it changes the way you can access things on the platform but disabling the back button tops the cake. Beyond that it doesnt matter how private you set your profile, how much you change the ad settings, ads are still popping up of things i discuss in the real world. With everything from the mic to audio to everything shut off that shouldnt happen. No one responds when you report something broken either or have a problem with login",1,bad
So the back button doesn't work unless you hold it for a few seconds on Android. However when you go back your news feed refreshes which is just as annoying. The constant refreshing of the news feed is pretty annoying. It's so strange how these companies are so huge and wealthy but they can't have an app that doesn't have bugs,1,bad
"UPDATE: Crashes immediately with an error message that there is a bug, and it will be fixed the next update. UPDATE: Keeps getting worse. With the newest update every time I post a comment,a notification pops up that says the person isn't in the group and can't see my message and that I should invite them. Worst app ever. Constantly freezes and shuts down. Slow as molasses. Notifications are delayed by days. Suggestion: Fix the problem that everyone is complaining about.",1,bad
"A new and very annoying inability to use my phone's back button has made checking multiple notifications absolutely infuriating since once I'm delivered wherever the notification takes me, I have to close the app and reopen to go to the next notification. I thought it was the phone, so I uninstalled then re-installed the app hoping to kick things back to normal. Nope. It's just Facebook wrecking a small but significant feature.",1,bad
"Was just scrolling thru some reels. Some had text that was going by too fast to read so I paused the reel and instead of stopping where it was, it kept showing the first frame of the reel. Didn't matter what part I paused on. First frame every time. If this is the standard and was on purpose it's stupid. Just so we have to watch the reel all over again and give them another view?? Why make it difficult?",1,bad
"The new changes are so incredibly irritating. I do not like the new layout, I accidentally bump the home button constantly now. Also, I am very confused as to why you would change all videos to reels? It's so frustrating to be watching a 15+ minute video, only to have it start from the very beginning any time you pause. You can't even fast forward back to where you were or see how long the video actually is any more. Hate it.",2,bad
This ad is the hardest ad to x out of. I think that they make the ads impossible to x out of because every time it opens they get brownie points or money or something. To me it's a scam and it irritates me to no end. Because on this ad when you push the first set of arrows on the left it shows you an x in the right-hand corner. But if you click on that to close it out it just takes you back into the ad you have to wait for the second arrow and you still can't edit the ad for 2-3 more attempts.,1,bad
"Same complaint. Back button no longer available. Additionally, I can no longer access / download files. Facebook wants me to change setting to allow for downloads. However, the option is not there under permission to do so. Scrolling down to Storage doesn't give me the option as well. There is a screenshot in Reddit with the same issue. There are no suggestions on how to resolve.",2,bad
"Back button STILL doesn't exit the app...is this a bug, or just them trying to keep you from leaving? Shows more & more new posts before you can close out. Can't leave a page I'm connected to, even though I'm no longer affiliated with the group running the page...this should not be difficult! Should be an easy-to-find, 1-click option. Attempts to contact Facebook through the app have been futile. Links often don't open in the app even though they're set to. Facebook never ceases to disappoint.",1,bad
"I've been on Facebook since 2007 and have had almost no issues. However when I go to add a family member it gives me a complete white blank screen when I click on the link ""add family member."" Yet I had no issues adding/updating Jobs or anything else. In addition it doesn't open links anymore unless I open them in an external browser. And it's not just the app I have this issue with it's the website too. And yes I've already cleared my cache more than once and make sure I had the latest update.",2,bad
"This is easily one of the worst apps to manage. Settings are a dumpster fire of confusion. Which I'm guessing is made that way on purpose to keep things working exactly the same. The default news feed is ridiculous. Even simple things like dark mode settings are impossible to find on certain devices. The design is boring, cluttered, and often confusing. I am so sick of that shade of blue. Are they still worried about brand recognition?",2,bad
"There's always something broken in this app. The feature ""Hide all from [page]"" hasn't worked consistently for years. The app will randomly scroll to the top of the news feed. Autoplay for videos only works sometimes. The latest update stopped the sound working in videos. I have the setting to open links externally turned on, but they still open within the app.",1,bad
"So annoying, nothing will even reload now. Pages I've unlikes still show up, and my feed is the same as it was yesterday. Nothing refreshed. I tried rebooting my phone even and still it doesn't work. They always mess this app up. The marketplace is really glitchy as well. Edit on 9-10-2023: Now when you search for an artist to use music on your stories, it gives really bad results. Instead of the artist you searched it lists a bunch of other artists and cover songs and lo-fi versions. Bad.",1,bad
"Don't think it will be noticed but I want to be able to add movies/shows/books to my profile. It has been YEARS since anyone has been able to it seems and the only thing that works like it is suppose to is the music. I can add and remove any song from my profile but the rest doesn't work as it should. Tried looking up movies and shows and can't even get it to show anything when searched. You probably won't fix this but if it did, I would give a better rating for sure.",1,neutral
"Every time I start reading a (usually lengthy) article, it just disappears before I can finish reading it, and goes to a blank page with the Facebook logo on it. So, now I don't even bother trying to read them. Very frustrating. My phone won't let me un-install Facebook, either. All I can do is 'disable' it. I'd like to get rid of it, and free up some space on my phone. I tried Facebook Lite, too, and it does the same thing.",2,bad
"I personally think Facebook is all bad from the get go. The continuous tracking and the mass amounts of media we download in a year on Social. BUT there is strong, very quick connection with alot of people at the power of your fingertips, so thats pretty cool so I'm thankful for that. We have the capability to quickly distribute alot of information to alot or people that all get instant alert notifications on there smart phones in a atomic second. Wow. Technology is so awesome!",3,good
"So tired of this app, the amount of times I've been locked out even with plenty of different ways of authenticating it's me is STUPID. today I am locked out of my account ONCE AGAIN for trying to turn off two factor authentication, and it's not like it's my fault either, when I try logging back in it only gives me two options, turn back on two factor authentication or learn more. Nothing else :)) and when I click on either the screen has a seizure becoming unusable. Yes I deleted and redownloade",1,bad
"I don't update any longer, because there is never an explanation of exactly what is being changed. I guess people are just so attached/hooked on both platforms that they just comply. If people stop updating due to no explanation and they can do whatever they want (you have agreed to the terms remember?) , then maybe things will change. Also, every update, brings more advertising.",3,bad
"All the updates to fix bugs, it just gets worse. The newsfeed is a mess and notifications out of order. RIDICULOJS ;( Why is it when I get a notification that someone has commented on my comment, I click on the notification and it never takes me to the comment. Something completely different comes up. Very frustrating!",1,bad
"Fun and entertaining. A great way to reconnect with old school friends.* Update: Facebook has become too biased and one-sided. Far too controlling and not as much fun. Some people live on it, I don't. My friends are Constantly getting their accounts Hacked by derelicts! I rarely use the app because of it. Too bad because it started out a fun way to stay connected now you don't know if the person you're talking to is the real thing or fake scam!! 😕",1,neutral
"The app has continuously fallen down hill for the last 5 to 7 months. Constant lagging, constant repeated loading screens on multiple devices, repeated failures to sync. Facebook seems hell bent on going backwards in technology and user ability lately. It reminds me of the the last few years of MySpace with the exception that Facebook seems to actively be taking a thrilling pleasure on crashing its own company. It seems after attempting to change to ""meta"" they said the hell with it.",1,bad
"Not everything has to be tiktok! Watching videos has become insufferable. It's extremely irritating that I can't go back or forth in a video, if I miss something and wanna go back, I can't. If I wanna skip the useless parts and just watch what the video is supposed to be about, I can't. It's so stupid. When you take ideas from other companies, you're supposed to take the good ideas, not the dumb parts that make your own app worse",1,bad
"Recently annoyed with the latest update. You can't pause on a certain part in reels, it just shows you the first frame high is super annoying. And I can't read comments easily anymore because my keyboard keeps popping up and then going down, then popping up again. When I hit the button to make it go away, the keyboard just pops up five seconds later. Fix it 🙄",1,bad
"Video watching is broken as hell, and it's been like this for years. Multiple videos play at the same time, ads are way way louder than the rest of the video, and ads get stuck and keep you from watching the video (after you watch the ad, of course). It claims that you have a new message at the top corner all of the time, even if you already read the message.",2,bad
"It seems like since the recent update there are a few buggy/glitchy issues. When it comes to posting anything, when I want to set the comments to ""public"" before posting, I choose public and hit submit but when I go to my page and go back to settings it still says ""friends only"". Is anyone else having this issue? The ads are getting rather annoying (and no FB you definitely don't want to make the mistake of paywalling us, not a smart move). The new layout, for me personally, is undesirable.",3,bad
"There is a big problem in this which has not been fixed for a long time even after getting daily updates. While watching reels, sometimes a random song starts playing and you can't even cut it, Even if Facebook is cut from the background or the screen is locked, the song will continue to play. Unless you uninstall Facebook or restart the phone.",2,bad
"System 'back' button not working on Android devices. Seems it's been a known issue for a while. This means you scroll down your newsfeed, click on comments to read or post a comment and you're stuck there. You can't go 'back', leaving you with no option but to close the app and restart it. Problem started spontaneously using the last version of the app, which prompted me to update to the latest version to discover there is no change. Perhaps not the app, but something at the 'Facebook end'",1,bad
"The mweb version for the marketplace is not great. The Ul is terrible. You cannot swipe through the image carousels. When you click to enlarge the images, you get a huge blank page and you have to move around the page to find the image. The alignment is all over the place. When in enlarged mode, you can't navigate to the next image. Overall bad service and all this should be rectify id not FB will be not usable any more. Biased platform, full of racists.",1,bad
"Ads in videos is the absolute worst. I'm not impressed. It's also impossible to find specific items (such as rims) in the marketplace. There needs to be a filter for certain criterias (such as bolt patterns, rim diameter, brands). Does not let me post buying/wanted ads which would save everyone lots of time when the seller comes to you. A lot of time is wasted browsing ads that are not relevant to your search. And now my back button doesn't work.",1,bad
"I've been having issues for the past couple of weeks with being able to view recent notifications in the app. I'll get a push notification, but when I click on the app to view it, it won't load. l've also been having difficulties with other areas loading as well (the main feed, profile, etc.). I tried uninstalling and reinstalling all updates (I would've done this with the app, but somehow that's not an option), to no avail.",1,bad
"Still can't upload full HD or higher quality with app . should use brower option also use the desktop version to upload full HD. Can't choose album when adding images under the comment section. Slow and buggy. So many buggs and problems . Now check-in notifications won't work. All pages wont show notification only for check-ins. Also, there is no option for it to be off or on.",1,bad
"Awful! For years, I have used the old desktop site, which was perfect. Last week, that told me my browser wasn't supported, when it really is!. So, I had to start using the app. It's just FULL of ads or suggested pages, which I really don't care about, not to mention the relentless marketplace posts!. I HIDE/Not Relevant all of the above, and they all appear again when it refreshes. Then there are the CONSTANT messages telling me 'someone has tried to access my account'...Yes.....ME!",1,bad
"Very unfriendly GUI. Menus constantly change, so no point memorising the branches of menus in order to find what you want. Most important of all, you cant have a ""videos/movies"" option on profiles in order to see them. If someone or a page has uploaded videos, you need to go to their photos menu and scroll down through thousands of photos to find that one video you're looking for. If you save it, it will open it but it won't play it. Sometimes, it will give an error and never open it at all.",1,bad
"I've been having issues for the past couple of weeks with being able to view recent notifications in the app. I'll get a push notification, but when I click on the app to view it, it won't load. I've also been having difficulties with other areas loading as well (the main feed, profile, etc.). I tried uninstalling and reinstalling all updates (I would've done this with the app, but somehow that's not an option), to no avail.",1,bad
"great app for communication, interaction and keeping up with the news about your loved ones, friends, and acquaintances. I just have two concerns though. first, there has been a bug since the new update wherein whenever I try to open the comment section and read the comments, it automatically opens the keyboard, and no matter how I keep on pressing the back button and turn down the keyboard, it keeps on opening. I also hope we'll be able to rearrange the music and play it constantly.",4,good
"And now the back button doesn't work, you're forced to use the apps back button in the upper left corner of the screen, which is extremely inconvenient. I have a feeling that this is intentional, it's exactly the kind if thing developers like to force on users because they're convinced it's better despite nobody liking or wanting it. If it is, revert. If it's a bug, then fix it. Either way, fix it.",1,bad
"The video player interface is really atrocious. There was a time when the interface feels good to use, then they decided to update to another interface which is clunky and hard to use. This app really needs to stick to one interface and improve it from there. Not changing the interface like changing clothes.",1,bad
"Been experiencing a""search"" issue, where I couldn't really search anything. Tried to clear my cache, reinstall the app. Tried to see if there's an internet issue. Even reported the issue on Facebook as well. After everything I did, nothing has been done. I have been experiencing this for almost 2 weeks already and found out that this was an isolated case. FACEBOOK, FIX THIS!! 🥹",1,bad
"Videos are basically lottery on this platform. Ex: You find something interesting and want to watch it full screen, you click on the video and suddenly it just turns black... It's black when you go full screen too. Then you accidentally change tabs or hit back button and pufff you lost the video you were watching.. Where is it? God knows... There is absolutely no way to find a video you recently watched. Great experience.",1,bad
"Last two updates are terrible. I cannot use my phone button to press go back, to previous screen. I have to click on the arrow, top left of the Facebook page to go back to the previous page. When I type a birthday message on Facebook, it doesn't put a space between words. It's showing me the same post, every time I open Facebook, that I have viewed, liked and commented on, for 5 days now. It doesn't refresh my news feed. Please fix it. The recent update was worse than prior update",2,bad
"Possibly the worst app on the Internet. In spite of recently doubling in size to over 100Mb, it still can't order news items chronologically and, in fact, changes the order each time you return to the start of the feed. And if that wasn't bad enough, items that you hide from your feed, reappear back within seconds. None of this happens when using FB through a browser. The app is the best reason to leave Facebook!",1,bad
"You can no longer watch videos in landscape, and they're now using the horrible Instagram format that blocks half the screen with buttons and writing. FB's improvements are garbage as usual. Also, it keeps jamming up your feed with ads and sponsored content. Meanwhile, you see very little from the pages you actually follow. Then there's FB's irritating little ""improvements."" The latest annoying feature is this pop-up that comes on when you take a screenshot, which blocks extended screenshots.",1,bad
"Why is it that half the time the ""back"" button on my phone doesn't work with this app? No other app has this problem. I am missing a lot of feeds from friends. Instead I get ad after ad after ad. Group or page suggestions get ridiculous. If you say you are not interested, your feed is then filled with more useless stuff. Holding an add just means it will pop up again. Time that Meta spent some of their ad revenue on building an app that might work better for the user.",1,bad
"My phone's back button refuses to work (and it's only with Facebook that this happens) and I'm sick of having to use the app's back button that's located all the way up at the top of the screen and that doesn't even show up half of the time. Please fix this, it's pissing me, my friends, and everyone else off. There are even many memes of this going around.",1,bad
"Absolutely garbage. Full of adverts, functionality is awful. Removal of the 'back button' has to be the worst idea yet! Decides what it will allow you to see, and there is no way to put posts in chronological order. In short, it's early 90's Internet without the charm of a dial up tone.",1,bad
"I'm really not sure what is going on with this app lately. It used to be my go-to for interactions and keeping up with friends and family. It was also a great tool to interact with different groups I chose and news feeds. Lately, it's just all ads. All the time. Repetitive ads, to boot! And now the back button no longer functions?!? What are you doing over there?!?",1,bad
"My stories are filled with suggested content from people I dont even follow. I can no longer see my friends' feed because all it shows is suggested for you and sponsored ads. Even if I add them as favorites, I dont see their feed. Videos have commercial ads, sometimes even 2 videos, almost a minute long. The support section is useless, and I can't find a way to turn these nuisanse off in settings.",1,bad
"Not sure if this is a bug or not but most of my old shared posts are missing and cannot be located on my profile's feed. I've tried everything from restarting my device to clearing the app's cache but still nothing. I've experienced the same error back then but it resolved within a day. But this time, nothing seems to work to fix the problem.",2,bad
"Notification issues, back or return button not working, app runs slow on current devices. The app notification don't clear after seen the first time, or sync with the website in a timely manner. Currently its issues are affecting how it's applies itself to different screen sizes, and my larger phone has a cramped app that doesn't coincide image to what's being pressed",1,bad
"Idk what has been happening lately but my fb app keeps giving me issues. The default back button doesnt work. I have to press the back arror at the top to go back, i hace a big phone and doing that requires two hands. Another thing is reels, when scrolling down about 70% of the time the videos wont play just the sound only. What i need to do is scroll up or down and return to that video in order for it to play the sound and video together. Please help",3,bad
"As others have mentioned, Facebook recently disabled the functionality of all phones built in ""back"" button. This is a major annoyance for users who have learned muscle memory of using the button in 99% of other apps. The ""back"" button is conveniently located under your fingers, rather than in the top left corner of the app. This was done without warning or reason given. Why intentionally make an app harder for users to navigate? One star review will remain until Facebook addresses this.",1,bad
"FB is going to lose a lot of its users. It's a platform for an older, less tech saavy demographic. Instead of spending the time tinkering with app and privacy settings to fix it, all those people are just going to stop using it. And FB is not going to tempt any new users. They have really destroyed one of the important ways a lot of us keep track of each other. Total fail.",1,bad
"Need a ""show all comments"" feature as a default instead of ""most relevant"" as a default. Tired of having to switch between these 2 everytime i wanna read the comments on a post. It's a simple issue yet annoying and there's no option to change it. Fix this, facebook. And one more thing, please, for the love of god, stop changing the UI. It gets annoying/confusing after a while trying to find where ""groups"" / ""marketplace"" are.. fix this, and i'll change my review.",1,bad
"Latest update made app nothing but SPAM. Every other or every third post is an advertisement. You hit Hide Ad, the feed does ""loading"" and freezes. Close out the app to get it working again and when you reopen, more ads. Wish I could undo the last update, it made the app unusable, can't even see people's posts due to the adverts freezing the app. I understand some ads, but trying to force feed it down my throat just made me take a step back from using facebook",1,bad
"Something weird is happening with this app..it does not exit out of the app at all, it I have no exit icon. It just hides it and comes right back. I have restrted my phone, Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I checked for updates. Nothing works. Facebook is just constantly open and running in the background. I do not like this. Please fix it!",1,bad
"After the update 10/27/23, I can't see any comments on any post. It's not my phone, it's only the Facebook app. Also, when I try to look at comments, it tells me no Internet connection and I do have Internet connection, because I am able access everything else on my phone, so obviously there's a bad glitch in the latest update. My phone isn't old, I've restarted, powered off, uninstalled, nothing fixes it. Please fix these problems, Facebook is even more useless if you can't read comments.",1,bad
"Loads slowly and shows posts I've already seen, many from days ago. Ad heavy experience, and most of those are for trash list articles. Newer version doesn't respect my system volume settings. If I have volume all the way down I still get sound from this app when interacting. I shouldn't have to silence my ringer to turn off in-app sounds. Key press tones are clearly not notifications or, so why does the app treat them like they are?",1,bad
"The System Navigation back button is not working within the app. Extremely frustrating. I found a thread saying it's been fixed and an update is available. No update for me, using a Samsung s23 Ultra. Please fix ASAP. Very annoying having to use the FB back button listed at the top of the screen that's out of the way.",1,bad
"On top of recently making the un-removable share popup on screenshot that ruins the ability to do a long scrolling screenshot, these a holes have disabled the ability to use the back button in-app, and you can now only use the back arrow at the top of the screen. This is just on the issues with the app itself and not on the awful mod policies. Thanks though, maybe this is finally the push I need to get off the awful hell app.",1,bad
"Terrible! Missing features, and my app is up to date. Was using FB dating and all the features are missing and I physically have to SEARCH for the ""app"" inside FB EVERY TIME. None of the features are working like the ""compliment"" feature and the messages are always delayed and no notification. AWFUL. Whatever update FB did, I always see my friends posts DAYS later and I miss everything!!",1,bad
"Suddenly, and without warning, the tyrrannical app began overriding the functionality of the phone by disabling the back button. Stars are like tips in a restaurant, taxi, or delivery service. The better you do, the more you get, until the max. But when you blow it, you get fewer! Now you see how that works, Mr. Snuffleuppagus?",1,bad
"Getting super annoyed by Facebook lately. Every time yall update, no problems get fixed, more just show up. Can't go back, most of the time you can't see replies to your comments, if I turn off my screen or have to leave for any reason and open the tab back up anything I was writing is gone just to show back up later that day randomly when I open the app again. It's becoming more trouble than it's worth.",1,bad
Before when you were using the market place and sending messages to the person through the chat you could go back to the item and check the details.. Now we can't do that anymore. Once you send a message you lose the page of the article. It's pretty annoying when you send several messages and then you can't check the price or which item was it! Please put it back like before !!!,1,bad
"The latest gripe is the back button. Stop fixing things that aren't broken. Any notification I get from a comment I made I can't view, sends me to a completely different video. Also, get rid of the ""most relevant"" comment filter I want to see all of them. If you're going to go that route adopt Reddit's upvote system, it's annoying to have to change every time.",1,good
"App is getting worse every update. Back button issues, I can't open links, when I switch devices I have to log in again and it's always a long aggravating process. Because FB seems to think I CAN'T REMEMBER MY OWN PASSWORD? Which I constantly have to keep changing because of it. I don't want it anymore. I get more ads, especially repetitive than posts from friends. It's garbage anymore, about to disconnect and sever ties completely with Zuck and Facebook.",1,bad
"Please bring back the option to open links in an external browser by default. Every time I click a link now, it will open but then redirects to a fake virus scan followed by a loud beep. The only way to open them externally is to click the link and then quickly select it in the upper right-hand corner before the fake virus scan starts. That is just unacceptable.",3,bad
"Since I uploaded 300+ images, I can't view my own Profile Page. Already did everything, from clear data/cache and uninstall/installing but the bug still persists. Checked it on mobile/web site and facebook lite but it's working fine. I think the app itself was the issue. It's been a month since I reported this but I didn't received any feedback. Kindly fix this please.",2,bad
"Back button wasn't working, notifications not showing up for over 24 hours, but most importantly, Marketplace keeps showing me results from 2 hours away from me, even after altering the parameter circle.

"There are a lot of bugs in the app recently, like being unable to use the back button when looking at newsfeeds, video reels, etc, and the screen keeps going black, but no updates are available for Android. Since Meta took over, both Facebook and Instagram have had continuous issues with no useful updates.",1,bad
"What is with all the glitches?! The back button is whatever; the glitches on the admin side of groups are a totally different thing! One minute I can give feedback on a comment, and literally 10 minutes later I don't have the option. Seriously? I could literally write a novel on all the random issues. The ""most recent"" selection on comments? The disappearing and reappearing notifications? The audience glitch? The picture glitches? Seriously, stop doing updates on an app that was just fine!",2,bad

This has been an ongoing problem and has hindered my ability to use the app effectively. I would appreciate your prompt assistance in resolving this matter.",1,bad
"So ticked off 🤬 Long scrolling screenshot is no longer working on my android, it is now a single screenshot with an un-removable share popup at the bottom of screen. This app is overstepping my control of my device since my phone already has the ability to share screenshots, and a share button is available on fb posts. They have also disabled the ability to use the back button while in the app. I can only use a back arrow at the top of the screen.",2,bad
"When I scroll through reels, some will have sound, then some wont, and i have to pause and then unpause the video to get it. If i go to view a notification on a past comment, it doesn't always bring me to my comment or the video i commented on. The back arrow doesnt work. Facebook used to be about connecting and communicating with friends and family, now it just feels like its attempting to be another youtube. I have more complaints but im running out of characters.",2,bad
"Marketplace is all screwed up. Editing a post makes it freeze and it never updates the changes. Once something is online, editing makes some sort of error not allowing the changes to update. Also the app would delete the images updated to the listing and when I try to upload the photos, it just shows a loading icon and never does anything",1,bad

This is so incredibly annoying, and it's been going on for three or four days now. it's about as annoying as someone continuing to poke you in the same spot over and over and over and now it's getting to be a real SORE spot with me. fix the issue, please. I'm considering deleting the app altogether.",1,bad
Apparently the updates broke the ability to use the system back button. Super annoying. You're forced to use the app's back button at the top of the screen. This is not convenient because it forces you to move around to areas that aren't ergonomicaly efficient. It's not a feature. It's a bug. Please fix it.,2,bad
"One star until you fix the issue where all my settings (dark mode, links open externally, no in app sounds, etc.) are reset when the app updates from the play store. Update 11/5/23: Still an issue. They've broken the app where links open internally regardless of the setting preference. App continues to log me out at random times. Would give zero stars if I could. The back button on Android no longer works in the Facebook app.",1,bad
"Facebook app does not allow me and multiple others (according to forums and reviews) use our phones back button once selected onto a post. We are only able to use Facebooks back button on the top left, which is super inconvenient and awkward for those of us with larger phones. Please fix this issue as it's starting to be noticed by a lot of us. Not just me like I thought.",1,bad
"Strange Feed & Back Button behavior, more and more I've noticed even if I block advertisers they show back up a few weeks later. My feed also doesn't show recent posts even though I've changed the settings to reflect that. Lastly now the back button doesn't work on my Pixel 8. The back option in the app itself does not the button in android does not.",1,bad
"New update done. I now cannot use my back button after viewing the notifications. Of its my post or a post I commented on, I can't use my back button. Seems to be a huge problem on Reddit for many android users. I've cleared cache, rebooted, uninstalled & reinstalled. Nothing works. Super annoying. Needs a bug fix. Report by shaking device when it happens. I really don't think FB reads anything sometimes.",1,bad
"As someone who works in UX, the back button functionality being taken away is giving me an aneurysm. Skipping around the interface like this is bad and you should feel bad. I've got small hands, I don't have time for this. Also, there are too many $&%*^ ads. Like every second post is an ad. What's Facebook for again?",1,bad
"It sucks! Pictures and videos haven't really loaded in weeks, now the back button is changed, it's constant ads and I rarely see friends post. I am about to delete it forever. I am a bit older (gen x ) and I don't got time to for this nonsense. I want something I can actually use! For reference I have an s23 ultra and live in los angeles so it's not like I have an old phone and live in bad internet reception. It's just these updates are screwing it up..please fix",1,bad
"I've been sharing posts in this platform and whenever I go to my profile to manage the posts I had shared, it just doesn't show up even I did not delete it nor hide it on my profile.

Another issue is I don't have featured collection option in my other account. Please, fix this.",2,bad
"Facebook Marketplace extremely glitchy. The ""NEWLY LISTED"" category vanishes after a couple of hours. You can clear cache data and reboot and it is still gone until you delete app and reinstall. A great way to get your download count up. I have reported this issue many times and they can not fix or won't. Using Samsung cell and tablet with no other issues except with Marketplace.",1,bad

Just to express my experience about some bugs I don't know if it's only me but when I'm watching videos there's a time that the audio will revert back 3 seconds while the video is on pause and will continue playing again if the audio sync with the video...happens many times I have two phones by the way and happens to both device...I tried reporting it on the main app but it's asking for a photo which is hard to provide/get... It's been happening for the past months I'm kind of annoyed with it.,4,neutral
"The app doesn't allow me to Switch Mode to Basic all the time. At first, it will let me switch modes back and forth to Basic. Then, it will just stuck in the non-Basic mode! The Switch Modes button flickers when tap. All other buttons respond. Only the Switch Modes button doesn't. Clear cache, restart device, etc. didn't work. Launching app while mobile data is off didn't work either. Without the Basic Mode, it was as if I'm paying for data bandwidth only to be consumed by ads. 😠",1,bad
"The most recent update caused the back button to cease working. More importantly, for the past month, my feed and in my groups, it is the older posts that show. In groups I have it set for most recent but I sometimes do not see the newer posts and comments for several hours after they are posted. This is something that just started occuring within this past month. I am not at all pleased with the latest few updates.",3,bad
"Since the new update, all the videos are being played in reels player and it has ruined my experience of watching videos on Facebook. It has no landscape full screen mode even though if you have your phone's screen orientation lock turned off video will never play in landscape mode. You can't change the video quality or you can change the video playback speed. I tried submitting the report but they won't answer. So I'm give this app one star until they bring back the old video player.",1,bad

"Well there have been issues off and on in various areas of this app, but none has raised the ire of users more than the recent disabling of the back button on Android devices. What were they thinking? Is it possible that this is a bug? If so, it should have been fixed immediately upon being discovered. The fact that it has been like this for days betrays either total incompetence, or a total lack of regard for the users' experience. I'm not sure which it is.",1,bad
"Terrible to control the time cursor when watching a video. You can't move it to the beginning because it's at the edge of the screen, and there's no double tap option to move forward or backward. If you interact with a video you must be redirected to the videos section. It's simply terrible to watch videos.",1,bad
"New update brought a bug that makes the back button feature not work. The app constantly changes layout, features come & go, news feed is all over the place - seeing same posts from days ago, so much spam on the whole site, Facebook bots aren't working very well. New notifications appear but when you tap on it there aren't any new notifications.",1,bad
"The back button is not working anymore. I dont know why they are rapidly changing the settings of the app without notification. I have multiple pages that appeared at my wall that forced me to see it while scrolling, i totally lost, and people i dont know who they are and where they are. And i why the algorithm selected these specific pages among all users. It's totally rude and uncomfortable to me.",1,bad
Using on a foldable is worse than a normal phone screen! Why does the default settings have to be zoomed in so much until a post is bigger than the entire screen and you have to maximize to actually zoom out!? There is also comments with black overlay blocking half the video in full screen mode. The app is so yucky and badly optimised on my Oppo find n3. Low resolution content and stretched across the entire page.,1,bad
"Managing pages is cumbersome. Same things over and over. I see less of my friends and favorites than I do sponsored posts. I'll get notifications, open the app, and they're not there until much later. If I open a browser, they're there. Business posts at insta need to be routable manually to the correct business page. Pre-filling interests/business types doesn't work for all businesses. Let us customize.",3,bad
"The app is as good as the Web version; full of ads and general rubbish most people probably don't care about. Facebook is all about the money; probably overloading people with junk so that they can create an ad-free subscription option. Marketplace is a scammers' dream; full of fake adverts for items that don't exist. I reported over half a dozen people advertising the same car, in totally different parts of the country, in one day and Facebook have done nothing about it.",1,bad
"Fix your photo and video quality. Whenever we story, it genuinely just becomes a 144-pixel type of a photo or video. Please fix this even though at my gallery it has its own affixed photo and video quality, but whenever I story, it just messes it up, and I hate it. My phone is great, I have enough space for photos and videos, and the quality is superb in my gallery, but whenever it comes to storying on Facebook, it messes it up. Why?",1,bad
"Opened the app to find my navigation bar had added a bunch of things I didn't want. Found where to customise it with pin, hide or auto... If I click hide, they pin! Choosing hide does the opposite so there's nothing I can do to get rid of gaming, events, friend requests, etc. What an annoying bug! Please fix this.",1,bad
"Back button function disabled. Now you have to hit the back arrow in the top left corner of your screen, which is great if you have abnormally long fingers and thumb.

The back button at the bottom of my phone doesn't work when I'm in the comments section of Facebook posts.

Hope to see improvements soon."" ⭐️⭐️",1,neutral

If I can't react, comment & share then what's the purpose of using this app. After several reports, they didn't fix my issue, this was a terrible experience, none of my issues were solved & if it's meta protected, don't you guys can identify that I'm the one who is using my profile & not somebody else. I'll have to uninstall unfortunately.",1,bad
"It just gets worse with every update. The only thing I can do on the app reliably is wait while it loads endlessly, trying to swap between my business profile and personal.

Enough with the constant updates (rolls eyes). Each update gets worse and worse. Ugh. If it ain't broke, stop repeatedly trying to fix it!!",1,bad
"I don't think there's a need for weekly updates given that the app doesn't seem to get much better, other than for 'security reasons' I mean. Works fairly decent when compared with web (mobile) version. And personally (not that it matters for the general user experience) I'm not a big fan of the 'style' or 're-re-design' the icons get every now and then. Hated the new icon.",3,neutral
Something is wrong with the app. I've had to close the app so many times as it would freeze quite often and restarting seem to be the only solution. Sometimes random audio would play in the background while watching reels and would continue even after closing the app.,3,bad
The app keeps on closing while I'm using it. It also has a lot of inappropriate sexual contents in the marketplace eventhough i don't click on it or search such items.

"Defaults ads to sort comments by 'most relevant' which hides comments and replies without telling user and helps scammers and bad products while also helping bots and fake replies stay up.

I see nothing but ""Sold"" items, but the filter screen is so trash, it won't let you scroll far enough to view options to remove these items.

Glitches, freezing screen, having to use the arrow at the top to navigate back vs. the back button I've ALWAYS used (android user.. this is one of many reasons why.. i like having a back/home button option) The ads are relentless.

"Again with ""fixing"" things that aren't broken. Except this time, you've actually broken it instead. Taking away the function of a back button on Androids is just idiotic. A button that is ergonomically placed right where the thumb already is when a phone is held, instead forcing us to use a poorly designed Facebook back button at the top left corner of the screen. Probably better for mental health and productivity to delete the app anyway.",1,bad

I don't like the way you ban the usage of my back button on your app. The back button is on every mobile phone on the planet and it's our right to use it anywhere Plus I don't like it when you chose to support a country that existed on other people's land and chose to close your eyes on the genocide crime featured on your algorithm everyday. These 2 points I'm writing here...It's against human rights.,1,bad

"Fix the back button issue. There is absolutely no reason why android users can't use their back button to move around the app. It's annoying and, if you're doing this to somehow cater to iPhone users, please get real.

The app doesnt play half the videos and its awkward to use, because 'likes' dont always work when you hit them.

Its like they think cats should be running the world. 🤣 I literally only keep it for my local marketplace.",1,bad

This most recent update (439.0.0.44.117) has broken the functionality of the back button. It's not ergonomically feasible to have to reach to the exact opposite corner of the screen to go back in pages when my hand naturally sits in the bottom 1/3rd of the screen.,2,bad
"There's a problem with the search algorithms within the platform. I used to search a lot whether it's a page, a photo, or anything else, the one I came up before is nothing to be shown anymore. I hope you can do something.",1,neutral
"Back button on my android stops working in the app if I have clicked into a post. Never had this issue before the update. It's also dumb that you can't exit the app using the back button anymore. Like Instagram and Tiktok, the back button just refreshes the screen to show us more posts and videos now. So annoying.",3,bad
"Re-enable the Android ""back"" button functionality!!! What idiot approved that change? Also - I'm unable to actually HIDE buttons from the navigation bar from the settings menu now. Every time I try, the app tries to PIN the button instead. I don't want gaming or groups or the marketplace at the top of my FB, and never will!",1,bad
"If I want to Share a Screenshot, I have in-built options in OS as well as a Share button in FB app to do so! Everytime I take a screenshot an irritating SHARE pop up comes on my screen! REMOVE THIS FEATURE! IT'S COSTING YOU NEGATIVE REVIEWS! Please don't make things Messy by adding unnecessary features in the app. Rather, it will be cool if the Developers work towards stability of an already great app!",1,bad
"The ""back"" button on my phone is no longer always going back on posts. It is working fine elsewhere, and does work sometimes. But it seems in comments it frequently requires me to click the back arrow at the top of the app instead.",2,neutral
"ADS HAVE DESTROYED FACEBOOK. It was great when I actually saw what my friends posted, but now it's all ads and business pages. The only good things about Facebook these days is memories and staying connected (I move a LOT). Otherwise I wouldn't bother with the app anymore. But you know, as long as the creators keep raking in the money......",1,bad
"Dear Facebook authorities, will you not improve the Facebook video feature? I saw in other people's IDs that they have reels but the Facebook main video feature is the same as before and not the reel system! But my ID has reels as well as the main videos come as reels which is very annoying! Thank you very much for introducing the Reels option but it's really disappointing when the main videos are also in Reels! Urgently request that the main Facebook videos feature be restored from the reels!",1,bad
"The active status light which I have made sure, was constantly off, has now been on every since this update on my business page, I don't need people to know when I'm active on Facebook, that was my sole purpose for keeping it off. I went through settings and made sure that they're off as well as the messenger, everything is off, but the status is still saying that I am active, I don't like that. It's a very inconvenience, and for my own privacy, I wanted to be off. Please fix this.",1,bad
I imagine the last update is the culprit but you can no longer see your matches chat response in Dating. It's not just on my end as others are experiencing it too. I won't hold my breath on it getting fixed. I maybe just awefulizing here but any attention they give this app usually results in 2 steps forward and 6 steps back. It's a bloated behemoth with too much going on. A simple suggestion is to allocate options to use Facebook dating in an external app of it's own. Ok rant over. Will update,1,bad
A partially nightmare on a foldable device... Every time I open or close my Samsung Galaxy Fold5 the Facebook app looses the context (leaves the page/position that I am currently watching) and switches back to the start page... this is ridiculous! 😡 It also often doesn't resize videos after closing the device. Shame on you FB developers... 😐,1,bad
"Right, so I've had FB since DAY 1. The mobile browser was great until they forced you onto the app only. This app is the most broken jank ever. Half the time it works and the other half the time it's loading nearly indefinitely due to really bad optimisation and literal faults in the code. Randomly just closes even though it's the only thing running on my Samsung S22 due to crashes. Randomly displays the wrong reacts, I could go on but I will just end up closing my account 🙃 😑 😒",1,bad
"when you open the app some random sounds will start playing and you will never see the video...even if you return to your home page the sound will still be playing...The other thing is that when l try to post a reel with your own sound,the video and sound never sync.....and that is so annoying🙄🙄🙄🏃when l installed it...like today, it already needed to be updated on the next day..Please l don't understand...this app always tells me that it needs an update every after three days!!",1,bad
"The settings keep changing and it always takes me ages to find things. The most annoying thing is that when I go to the help articles, the directions there never match the actual settings, so they are useless. One last thing: I hate the new graphics style. Looking for an alternative.",1,neutral
It is very annoying that Facebook isn't even social media anymore! It's just scrolling through posts from pages I DON'T FOLLOW and videos I don't want to see! I have to scroll past at least five useless posts before I see a post from a friend. I really don't like this. There's no way to change this in settings. Facebook is now just a waste of time.,1,bad
"Notifications worked for exactly one day after I installed the app. Now, none of the notifications work. I didn't change any settings on the app or phone. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times, but I still don't get any notifications. It's very frustrating. Makes me want to get an iPhone just so I can use Facebook.",1,bad

"I wish I could give this app 0 rating. It's extremely invasive with ads and recommended trash I don't care about. Lately it's gone worse and worse, giving me suggested ""TikTok-like"" videos. 3rd party apps don't have suggested content and ads that show up literally every second post. And also don't hide posts from friends I interact less with. I got fed up, uninstalled it and downloaded a 3rd party app. And now they get a bad review.",1,bad

I can't see the time limit of the video when I'm watching the video. Another problem is that I can't be taken forward or backward. This problem appears after updating the application. After uninstalling the application I am installing it again but the same problem is occurring. Now the solution is that I can see my Facebook video as before. Please solve the problem quickly.,1,neutral
"Not impressed with a wall of just adverts, even if you call them ""sponsored posts"" they're still adverts. Incredibly disappointing but not surprising that you're allowing adverts for high risk unproven medical treatments. Is it at all possible to have the app operate with at least SOME measure of reliability? Next to no posts from friends, and the ones that do come through are WEEKS old so's to be practically irrelevant. It's as if Facebook is trying to encourage people not to bother with it.",1,bad
"I personally think Facebook is all bad from the get go. The continuous tracking and the mass amounts of media we download in a year on Social. BUT there is strong, very quick connection with alot of people at the power of your fingertips, so thats pretty cool so I'm thankful for that. We have the capability to quickly distribute alot of information to alot or people",1,bad

I got hacked, and the person changed my email address so now I can't do nothing about it because I can't get my password changed and there's no Tech. Support agent from Facebook to explain my problem too. I'll be changing the passwords from all my accounts related to it now (Including the bank) because they may be compromised. I'm never using this app again in my life.",1,bad
"I stop scrolling to watch a video. There's an ad above the video and an ad below. The video stops to show me an ad. A smaller ad appears at the bottom of the video. This is ridiculous, almost unusable.",1,bad
"Since the last update, this app is not working properly. The biggest complaint/ concerns that I have are that it doesn't remember my device when I log in(even though it's set to remember it), and it says my location is 40 minutes away. No where near my home. This app used to be very good and accurate on location and remembering devices, especially for security purposes. Not so much these last few times. Not too happy with your product right now.",1,bad
"When you open an Instagram link, Facebook app logs you out. Logging back in doesn't help because it kicks you out almost immediately. Killing all apps and logging back in helps, but it is annoying that you have to do this each time you check Instagram.",3,neutral
"I've been a dedicated Meta user since 2009, but my account was hacked and is now locked for over a month! Despite going through identity verification multiple times and being a verified Instagram member, I've raised multiple tickets.

I hope the developer team will take notice and resolve this matter promptly.",1,bad

"I don't know why but I've never had this problem. For some reason after a little while, videos stop working. This has been going on for at least a couple weeks. I have great Internet for it not to be working. When I use other apps (like X, Snapchat, Instagram) I never have a problem with videos. It's just Facebook. I'm a try reinstalling it to see if that helps. Either outcome I'll update this, so wish me luck lol Edit: STILL DOING IT!! Smh",1,bad

"Constant abs and garbage. As you scroll it's literally ""ad, suggestion for you, ad, a post from your friends"" on repeat. Half of the good stuff is hidden and then when you finally get on a video from a person you follow there's another ad and then the often changes too stupid Tik Tok garbage videos. The only good thing about it is Marketplace and even in that the search functions and parameters that gives you are annoyingly restrictive.",1,bad
"This app is going downhill, fast. As a Canadian, I no longer get shown Canadian pages, instead my feed is filled with irrelevant garbage that I can't opt out of seeing. And now I'm getting notifications on Facebook about my Instagram notifications, which is so completely unnecessary.",1,bad
"Glitches, full of ads, groups and sponsored stuff, long before seeing any friends. Sometimes reaction emojis don't work, no, often they don't work until I shut the app and open it again.

Lots of things need fixing, ""Meta"", please get on with it!",1,bad

"Horrible buggy experience you can't do anything without some stupid bug not getting in the way. Everything is also hidden under millions of tabs and folders, making anything impossible to find without googling how to do it. Waste of space wish I could completely get rid of this garbage leech of an app off my phone.",1,bad

"Not only have you gone and screwed up the ability to go back with the phone button with the latest update, this is one of the most insecure social media platforms available today. Meta has the ability to keep people safer. Reporting hackers and scammers goes ignored or FB comes back saying it doesn't violate standards. People are being breached constantly and Zuck knows and doesn't do anything about it. There needs to be a better algorithm to filter things out & more effort on security/safety",1,bad
"Doesn't work as intended. Still getting the same type of news despite flagging said content as irrelevant and confirming that I don't want that type of content to show on my timeline. Doesn't show me any diversity, if anything random content that's irrelevant, fix your filtering issues. And give a clearer interface, this one isn't as appealing, and add more variety to the content being displayed, to allow us to learn more about different cultures worldwide and be able to connect with others.",1,bad
"never write reviews but this Facebook app is horrible! I don't update it often because every time I do 1 have a new issue. I updated it this morning and it won't even open now.

"I don't know how it is possible for them to repeatedly make this app worse with each new update, but they've done it. I feel like I'm so tied to it that I can never delete it, but I literally HATE using this app. Marketplace is where most people go to buy/sell nowadays and yet marketplace still has the algorithm of 2000s-era CraigsList, my news feed is NOTHING BUT ""suggested for you"" posts or ads, or 5 day old posts, plus the ads in videos, no freedom of speech etc. I hate this app so much.",1,bad

Absolutely sh**! What the hell kind of app doesn't allow you to use the back button? This app gets worse not better! I've updated this app. Updated messenger. Updated software. Even tried it on 4 other phones. Same problems. Mariam to call me. Its just awful. I wish they'd fix it.,1,bad
"There's a reason why the Google Play rating of Facebook has dropped to just 2.5 stars, and dropping all the time. My newsfeed is dominated by ads I can't get rid of, ""suggested for you"", ""groups you may like"" and ""friends you may know"". Their help page is shocking. I hide an ad and we get ""you won't see this ad again"", 3 mins later and it's back!

Horrible costumer service or help. My account got hacked 2 nights ago and still have yet to gain any help. The help center is absolutely useless and it never leads to an actual person. I have had an account for almost 20yrs and not an ounce of help when I actually need it. I only want my account back for all my memories and messages or I wouldn't care at all. The ads are just awful now as well. Facebook has changed and not for the best,1,bad

I always give an app leeway with ads, I already have to see them scrolling through my friends past posts now as well as my home feed or any other place I however am not going to stand for my phone automatically getting scrolled up to an advertisement after I had already passed it. You blew it. I'm reverting to old versions and turning off auto updates I'll update my apps manually. Already uninstalled the meta system apps nice try. I'm done with ads on Facebook.",1,bad

Blocking a user from your personal account should automatically block them from your business page without having to use the meta suite on a desktop, not everyone owns a laptop these days.

Although I like the concept of it and keep in contact with people, but when I ordered a iPhone from Xfinity that came with the SIM card already in use by somebody who hacked my facebook account with the phone number that came on SIM card straight through Xfinity. So there's just more than one to blame. I can't blame facebook fully for being hacked for 2 years.",2,bad
Since the last update my back button doesn't work and my posts are glitching. Uploading images and videos has become extremely difficult. My notifications don't show either in the notification tab unless I manually refresh it.,1,bad
The music selection sucks & is super limited. Facebook marketplace is a dumpster fire. I was really hoping they'd work hard to improve marketplace but it's only gotten worse.

Notifications don't work. Settings are impossible to understand and navigate.

Then there is the older problem of seeing less of our friends and families post and more ads, groups and content creators. Do better!",2,bad

"Updates have generally made this worse but the latest update which disables your phones back button is the final straw, unusable now. Who allowed this? The best advice right now is to use FB in your browser where you can also disable ads or get one of the third party alternative apps, this one is absolutely unusable and should be avoided at all costs. I only gave it one star because I was forced to, 0 stars would be more honest",1,bad
Absolutely sh**! What the hell kind of app doesn't allow you to use the back button? This app gets worse not better! I've updated this app. Updated messenger. Updated software. Even tried it on 4 other phones. Same problems. Mariam to call me. Its just awful. I wish they'd fix it.,1,bad

Comments are erased if you go to another app temporarily. Can't select photos to complete form to list item on marketplace.

Back button functionality is broken. Clicking on notifications (under the bell) is marking them as read instead of clicking through to the post. Frustrating enough to keep me off the app.,1,bad
11/10 they still have not fixed issue after MANY attempts of contact -.- 8/23 Fb dating is gone and no longer accessible. May update once it returns. Made multiple attempts to fix issue with support and received no response.,1,bad
Unusable The app goes to a black screen every 3 seconds and you have to back out of it just for it to come right back. Can not use any more. This may be the push I needed to stop using Facebook.,1,bad
The sound quality on the videos are horrible. It glitches and jumps. It opens more than 1 window when you go into the app. Sometimes the back button doesn't work and you have to force stop the app to actually get out. The app is really unstable.,1,bad

I have logged out and back in. Same",2,bad
"Forced removal of the use of my back button has made me avoid even opening Facebook anymore to even check notifications. All of the ads had gotten out of hand already but this is so unnecessary it's almost like a personal attack to try to trick their numbers of ""active"" people when in reality it's everyone hitting their back button over and over out of habit.

Ever since the latest update that Facebook did here in the Google play store. App either crashes constantly or doesn't even work when tapping on the app. Wait and Wait still doesn't load or open.

Watching videos is obnoxious. They're all reals now you can't fast forward rewind or pause to read things bcuz it just shows you the 1st frame.reading comments is obnoxious bcuz it just shows you the most relevant ones & if you don't remember to click all comments at the very beginning of opening the comment section you have to back out completely then go back into it & hit all comments.

Everytime I open the app it says do you want to allow notifications. Tried multiple ways to get facebook to stop asking me.

Any kind of themed template you can think of. It has 100+ themes and fonts and you can use tons of filters! The only bad thing is that most of the good filters and effects are for pro members when you try to create a template. Also, Capcut is great for editing! Hope this helps!",5,good

They removed the ""Watch"" video tab as an option from the navigation bar so they can try to shove the ""reels"" and TikTok culture down your throat. In the latest update they also changed the navigation bar to be at the bottom with no way to change it back.

"There's a reason why the Google Play rating of Facebook has dropped to just 2.5 stars, and dropping all the time. My newsfeed is dominated by ads I can't get rid of, ""suggested for you"", ""groups you may like"" and ""friends you may know"". Their help page is shocking. I hide an ad and we get ""you won't see this ad again"", 3 mins later and it's back!

"Too many glitches to list, Especially if using the app on a tablet. edit to add: when fb ""reviews"" something that is reported, there should be an option to leave a message and a way to request a person instead of a computer algorithm to verify if it is legit. Too many scam accounts and stolen accounts and Facebook isn't doing except saying ""doesn't go against community standards"". If a person was assigned the report to review, they could clearly see something isn't right.",1,bad

Looks much different and losing its normally, can't watch videos coz 2 many ads, sometimes can't post similar things, can't back on previous one .

I purchased an item on facebook. The item was suppose to be shipped. The seller (Thomas J Harris of Portland) committed fraud and did not send the item. The seller blocked me and refunded me $1.06. The item purchased was $108 with $14.00 for shipping. The seller then relisted the item for other people to be defrauded. By blocking me and refunding me $1.06. Facebook has a flaw that does not allow me to give him a seller rating or dispute the charge. I sent facebook an email... no response,1,bad
The sound quality on the videos are horrible. It glitches and jumps. It opens more than 1 window when you go into the app. Sometimes the back button doesn't work and you have to force stop the app to actually get out. The app is really unstable.,1,bad
"Settings show this turned on shortly after forcing closed. Lost the use of the back button. It seems the app is taking over the phone, I'm getting very close to removing app altogether.",2,bad

In fact, it doesn't do anything. So, I always have to press the back arrow button on the top left hand side of the screen. It's not that much a problem until you're in hurry to go back to home page. Please fix it. Thank you.",2,bad
"With recent updates the app is ""Recent updates have taken a toll on the Facebook app's user experience.

Back button functionality is broken. Clicking on notifications (under the bell) is marking them as read instead of clicking through to the post. Frustrating enough to keep me off the app.,1,bad
"Within the last week I suddenly cannot do landscape live videos. I've been doing them for a couple of years now so I know exactly what I'm doing.

Now,I can't find a way to change it back. BTW, my husband's name is responding to my FB friends. He's also attracted some friends. I give marketplace a 3. Vette still for sale.",3,neutral
"Forced removal of the use of my back button has made me avoid even opening Facebook anymore to even check notifications. All of the ads had gotten out of hand already but this is so unnecessary it's almost like a personal attack to try to trick their numbers of ""active"" people when in reality it's everyone hitting their back button over and over out of habit. Time to downloaded X, TikTok, and maybe Truth Social before using this garbage again.",1,bad

We had Face In Hole where you could create fun or silly pictures. It's all gone. Now we get those video shorts that is strun with drama and profanity. Most videos are so bad, you can't go very long without hearing someone drop the ""F"" bomb several times. I gave Facebook two stars; and that was being very generous. Facebook barely deserves half a star.",2,bad
"Facebook, in recent months has completely screwed up the algorithm to where 95% of my feed is just old posts from weeks back and of course... tons of useless ads. No amount of fiddling with the very limited settings I have on my side do anything to fix this. They seem to hate anyone who doesn't share their woke, liberal point of view, so I guess this is probably their version of punishment. It's a lousy company just ripe to head into illrelivancy.",1,bad
"Currently unable to open links in app. Sent several reports. Have yet to hear anything from fb. App overall is only getting unbearable. Had a good run, but ultimately, this app is only getting worse.",1,bad
Watching videos is obnoxious. They're all reals now you can't fast forward rewind or pause to read things bcuz it just shows you the 1st frame.reading comments is obnoxious bcuz it just shows you the most relevant ones & if you don't remember to click all comments at the very beginning of opening the comment section you have to back out completely then go back into it & hit all comments. My back button stopped working. Only some ppls avatars are animated for some reason. I want mine to be too.,2,bad
Everytime you do an update I have uninstall the app and reinstall and even that doesn't fix all the problems getting to the stage about to get rid of Facebook totally. Now it open twice everytime....😡😡😡😡,1,bad
"Facebook let's strangers tag people to spam unauthorized sales, and let's the tag error out when removed. Now it shows you stories of random accounts that you have to hide, one by one. If you leave the app open, audio for videos doesn't work and you need to restart to hear them. This app sucks now. Ads every two posts, often repeating ones you hid because YOU SEE IT TOO OFTEN!!!!",1,bad

"I mainly use this app for the marketplace. I've had successful deals and never asked people that I've dealt with for ratings. Ratings used to be a two way street before where items should have been sold first and Facebook would ask for verification on both parties if a deal was made. Now as a seller, anyone can rate you even if no deal was made and all it takes is communication via messenger and you can't dispute or do anything about the rate given to you because Facebook Karens deems it fair.",1,good
"I use it. Everyone uses it, so I kinda have to too. It is what it is. The way the feed behaves is INSANE. I'm so tired of the updating, resetting, going to ""the top,"" every three seconds. Bounce over to another app and come back, the post you left it on is now lost at sea. Back out of the comment section? Now you're at the top of your feed and the posts are re-randomized so you can't just scroll a bit to get back where you were. So incredibly frustrating. Honestly it's almost unusable.",1,bad
"Since updating the android back button doesn't work, so you basically have to use both hands when wanting to go back because my thumb doesn't reach the Facebook back button. Also I cannot connect to my granddaughter's kids messenger, I've written Facebook support about this with no reply or help....my husband and other family members it works for, but not me.😡",1,bad
"It just gets worse with every update. The only thing I can do on the app reliably is wait while it loads endlessly, trying to swap between my business profile and personal. Integrating them has just led to nothing working. What an awful app! On the plus, far less time is spent on social media, so thanks for making me want to do anything else instead! 🤣 😂",1,bad
FB decided to move the navigation bar to the bottom of the page which I understand is the norm for iPhone users. However I don't use a iPhone and don't want the navigation bar at the bottom of the page. Apparently they give no option for moving it back to the top.,1,bad
"I am disabled and I do not live close to family. FB used responsibly is a great way to keep in touch with loved ones and reconnect with acquaintances,learn about new products, and community events.

"I like the ideas and suggestions on Facebook. There are a lot of fun stuff. The people are very nice and friendly. They make me feel happy. Good videos to watch. There is a lot to see and do. Like learning how to create new meals and recipes. So good and easy to make. Very tasty some are even cute ideas for your children. The crafts are amazing, Great ideas! You really need to check them out they are so created. Amazing ideas and you can sell the products you were working on. Great projects.😀😄",5,good
"Sick to death of it logging me out all of the time and having to log back in. All software and Facebook is upto date with all possible updates but still does it. Can see things I've been tagged in. Posts I've been tagged in dissapear. News feed is completely random showing things from anything up to a week ago, not showing things in post order and just lately way too many pointless advertisements that I quite frankly don't want to see as they are getting annoying. What is going in sort it out!",1,bad
"here's the latest in the, let's ruin Facebook saga. the new video player is made to be like reels. you cannot rewind or move the marker back to watch an earlier segment of the video. and if I click on something else or goto another page for a sec and come back to the video, it starts itself all over again and I can't fast forward so I have to watch a long video all over again. I often just close the app after that. thanks Mark Zuckerberg. doing gods work over there clearly 🙄",1,bad

"Not impressed with a wall of just adverts, even if you call them ""sponsored posts"" they're still adverts. Incredibly disappointing but not surprising that you're allowing adverts for high risk unproven medical treatments. Is it at all possible to have the app operate with at least SOME measure of reliability? Next to no posts from friends, and the ones that do come through are WEEKS old so's to be practically irrelevant. It's as if Facebook is trying to encourage people not to bother with it.",1,bad

"When i set a post privacy to just me, then I want to change it to anything like friends etc,I can't because the Edit Privacy option no longer appears. What with the back button issue, this latest update/updates have been some of the worst",1,bad
Unusable The app goes to a black screen every 3 seconds and you have to back out of it just for it to come right back. Can not use any more. This may be the push I needed to stop using Facebook.,1,bad
Honestly if it weren't for the special interest groups that I'm a part of I'd leave this app. They block real journalism while allowing hate and bigotry to spread. Their reporting function is a joke at best and I've yet to see any positive results from reporting scammers or hate speech. It does make blocking other users easy which helps with the above issues. Also the ads will take over your feeds. About 1/3 of the posts I see are ads.,1,bad
"Backwards Evolution in this app. I open my Newsfeed, and on the 2nd post I encounter, I get a useless Ad. I snooze it, hide it, tell Facebook I never want to see it again. I see 1-2 posts, often DAYS old, and then the same ad I just hid is back. Updating my ad preferences matters none. Most recently the back arrow... I open comments to interact, but I can't. It automatically opens me to a random place in the thread, I push back, then again, and again, and maybe by the 4th time it works.",1,bad
"Byzantine settings that are constantly changing/moving, no doubt to revert any setting that increases user control or reduces fb's ability to mine data. Just spent a long time rewriting a comment when screen abruptly switched to my Newsfeed, sending work into ether. Also, the fact that there's no way to turn off the AI or whatever it is that tries to complete comments is EXTREMELY annoying, wastes my time, and is indefensible. Makes me hate FB/Meta even more than b4. Use fb lite or nothing.",1,bad
"Used to be decent now it just crashes constantly... Every time I use the App it ""stops responding"" and I don't mean like once in a blue moon... I mean every single time I open it. I've Uninstalled it, reinstalled it, cleared the cache, etc. Whatever they did, they need to undo it because it went from a 3 star app and platform to a negative platform. If they're trying to suck, they are succeeding with flying colors.",1,bad
"This platform is getting worse everyday and now it's becoming unbearable Soo many bug i said ok, awful performance also ok Buttons dont work also ok But now im getting awful ads and posts that I can't avoid even after stating that im not interested, blocking and reporting.

Messenger changed for some reason. It looks different and I can't copy the text from a message in messenger. I have no idea why. I don't get the option anymore. Back button is annoying but doable. I copy a lot from messenger for my job so this is annoying.,2,bad
Please fix the bug where one can't hit the back button on their device to go back (not the button in the app). The most recent update made this occur. Thank you.,2,bad
"Each time an ""update"" FORCES us to accept it, it seems as though it takes away something else that made us like the app in the 1st place, meaning take away something that FB had originally had no access to, & now we are FORCED to ""UPDATE"" their policies which in turn only seem to benefit FB by invading even more of our privacy like constantly tracking us, or being able to access our microphones even after we turn it off, or take away a FB permission they simply find ways to be even more invasive",1,bad
"Notifications worked for exactly one day after I installed the app. Now, none of the notifications work. I didn't change any settings on the app or phone.

"Do not want someone with bias, fact checking anything. I can do my own fact checking! This is ridiculous . Update 11/23 The above is true and now they made functionality even worse for at least Android users. Can't back out of a page with back button. Why... more control over my phone?",1,bad

"Absolutely terrible app, I never want to use it and would sue if I could, all starting with me waking up one morning being logged about of messenger and unable to log back in, I thought no problem I'll just email them or call em, guess what, they have absolutely not contact, just a dum system which does nothing. Sooner or later I realise my Facebook acct is entirely gone.",1,bad
"Problem with sound on videos since last update. All web advice says is to check device settings, but device is fine and sound on other apps works without a problem. Ads are mostly irrelevant too; I get really random stuff through that's not related to any of my searches or interests. Guess it's a case of who pays most to invade news feeds unfortunately.",2,bad
"I've seen what the latest update did to everybody else, nope, never letting this app update ever again. I'm sticking with the last usable version until either it stops working or you dumfuks fix it... And if Google ever forces their hand on updates like Microsoft did and takes that choice away from me, I'm uninstalling this and most other apps that have been permanently ruined by updates.",1,bad
New phone new download.. so when were pop up ads put in on Facebook videos. It's annoying to say the least. And answers the question of why the video player wasn't working the pop up ads wasn't registering leaving it in a endless loop of buffering. And what dose it say that even Google thinks pop up ads are stupid.,1,bad
All of my Facebook marketplace conversations are all blank for some strange reason. Even after sending a new message through Facebook marketplace and then closing the app and then reopening the app the message that I just sent is blank. I can see all my Facebook marketplace conversations on my computer but not on my phone anymore.,1,bad
FB is so glitchy now I can't even get it in English and I've made countless attempts to fix it. The new format completely doesn't work andooks terrible. The reels don't work. The constant harassment and punishments over nothing which even includes liking to many times is beyond stupid. The lack of protection from hackers and scammers is bad. I'd give FB less than a one star if I could.,1,bad
"The app won't load at all....it stays on the Facebook page with the loading dots. I can log in via my browser, but I can't get the app to work at all. I have tried reporting it, but that option only comes up occasionally and they are apparently ignoring it",1,bad
"Just annoyed it's been years and the phantom messages still exist. Like my messenger will be completely read and all that but open up Facebook and I have a notification in messenger. I check messenger there's nothing there. I end up having to go to my browser in desktop mode just to see that ""notification"" was literally just me replying to someone and it was ""unread"".",2,bad
"Toxic UX with dark patterns such as disabling the back button, showing third party accounts even after stating not interested and a timeline that is more about things I don't care than people I care. Oh, and I never gave permissions to the app to scan my contacts and it did it anyways.",1,bad
"Ever since I update it , app crash & always log out me out every 10 mins .

The notification section is way messed up. At the top are days and even weeks old notifications and I have to scroll way down to get current notifications. Now on top of everything the app either won't open or it force closes 70 percent of the time if not more. If this is fixed I will give more stars,1,bad
FYI guys. This version does not sync any user data. When u login theres no friends or custom feed. Tried on three phones same thing. Instead I logged in via chrome (all friends and feed normal) and made a shortcut to the main screen and use that instead. You need to fix your app.,1,bad

Play pause full screen toggle buttons missing from video screens, when I press it on the video window 3-4 times with judgement sometimes it works sometimes does not.

Not digging the new setup in settings either its all screwed up..honestly makes me want to delete it Facebook is getting ridiculous anyway .",1,bad
The in-app web browser really sucks. Can't even implement a decent in-app web browser as a basic requirement. My god. And not to mention the entire Facebook user features is so limited that it's pathetic. U can't even do a decent search on anything using basic filters like time range. I wld give a 0 stars if i could.,1,bad
"Facebook has been an essential part of my social life for years. It's a platform that keeps me connected with friends and family, no matter where they are in the world.

"Facebook recently has been flooding the timeline with 'suggested for you' pages. I don't know what new algorithm they have applied but this has become a huge nuisance. It seems Facebook is pushing the pages followed by our contacts. There is no need to introduce this irritating feature. If this feature is not stopped, I bet millions will leave FB.",2,bad
Boring...dosnt work well. Needs to refresh always. Freezes. Its exhausting!!!! The app has changed. Too much bias and censorship going on and it's not as fun as it was years ago. Freedom of speech has lost its way. The app freezes and lags and wont allow me to upload videos. It's become draining just like Facebook. 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸,1,bad
About a week ago the screen/tab to see notifications stopped working. Get an error saying it can't load. I can see notifications fine on the web browser. No amount of reinstalling and cashe clearing has helped. Sorta hard to be social with people in social media if you don't know when they're interacting with you.,1,bad
I can't see the time limit of the video when I'm watching the video. Another problem is that I can't be taken forward or backward. This problem appears after updating the application. After uninstalling the application I am installing it again but the same problem is occurring. Now the solution is that I can see my Facebook video as before. Please solve the problem quickly.,1,neutral
"What is happening? I'm in a FB group, and we are all experiencing our photos droppings and/or not being able to upload a photo to a comment that we've made. Even photos that were posted a few days ago have suddenly disappeared??This all just started today.I've tried editing my comment to add my photo back on again (even tried a different pic), & the system tells me that it is working on it,but then nothing happens.But it's not every picture. Some do upload, and some don't. It seems random",1,bad
"BTW, it doesn't matter about updates anyway, because there's so much going on in the app. My AVATARS are STILL MISSING, and the ones I have are distorted, my news feed is stuck. Facebook administrators NEVER know where I am, and if it's me or not. 🤷🏾‍♀️ They have screwed around with the special FONT I purchased from Samsung, and never improve even after feedback. I don't even know why I bother. And it's updating is as slow as MOLASSES! UGH! 🤬",1,bad
"Now to complicated. The app was user friendly before now but I don't know what is wrong with Facebook Developers and the Company. The app is becoming worse with every new update. Ease of navigation is 0%. Notifications are no longer arranged according to time. The app just restricts someone's post by not allowing friends to see them. Settings are now too complicated, you can't easily find what you are looking for. Now you cannot even manage your Pages on the app. I might just delete my account.",1,bad
"My Facebook account was hacked by someone adding an email, sending a password reset, and then changing my password immediately. Since then, I've tried for over 24 hours to try to get it resolved. Of course, Facebook doesn't allow you to talk to any real people, and somehow there's no way to tell their bot that the link they send hasn't worked any of the 30+ times I've gotten it. And fun bonus - every time I get that link, so does the hacker. So meanwhile, a scammer just gets to freely post. 🙄",1,bad
"No longer able to open links in an external browser! You used to be able to change this in the ""Media"" settings, but now it's just for links in messages. I do not want to use Facebook's browser for ANYTHING, but now it seems there's no choice.",1,bad
"Right, so I've had FB since DAY 1. The mobile browser was great until they forced you onto the app only. This app is the most broken jank ever. Half the time it works and the other half the time it's loading nearly indefinitely due to really bad optimisation and literal faults in the code. Randomly just closes even though it's the only thing running on my Samsung S22 due to crashes. Randomly displays the wrong reacts, I could go on but I will just end up closing my account 🙃 😑 😒",1,bad
"One of the past updates ruined being able to watch videos in the video section.

"I don't think there's a need for weekly updates given that the app doesn't seem to get much better, other than for 'security reasons' I mean. Works fairly decent when compared with web (mobile) version. And personally (not that it matters for the general user experience) I'm not a big fan of the 'style' or 're-re-design' the icons get every now and then. Hated the new icon.",3,neutral
It is very annoying that Facebook isn't even social media anymore! It's just scrolling through posts from pages I DON'T FOLLOW and videos I don't want to see! I have to scroll past at least five useless posts before I see a post from a friend. I really don't like this. There's no way to change this in settings. Facebook is now just a waste of time.,1,bad
"After the last couple of years, this app has greatly degraded, IMO. Too many ""sponsored"" or ""suggested for you"" notifications and ads, with fewer posts from Facebook friends and groups. The few friends and group posts that make it through are sometimes difficult to open and view. The settings seem to be designed to where you don't have much control over the volume of ads and commercials you are bombarted with daily. I understand ads are what keep Facebook a free app, but this is getting crazy!",2,bad
"All links now open in browser unless coming exclusively from messenger. No option to use phone system browser on android.

If I try to say music from someone else's reel it doesn't allow me to do that anymore. There's no way to reach Facebook tech support. The help option doesn't help me at all. Google search says go to settings clear cache and install new version. Someone who knows about this please please help",1,bad
"I can't understand what you update new version for. The problem is still same. I still can't hide the keyboard in the 'Comment' screen in one 'back' tap as I could did before, I have to press 'back' button on my phone 3 times to hide keyboard and quit the 'comment' screen. In this 3 'back' taps, it still jumps up and down laggingly. You update new version for what if it's still not effective than the previous one???? So disappointed",1,bad
I hate that the app now has ads that interrupt watching videos now! I don't know about anyone else but I keep seeing pornographic ads that I'm constantly reporting but the still showup! And now the ads are freezing up and I'm trying to simply remove caches to fix but I'm going to have to uninstall to see if that helps. So many issues now along with killing free speech!! UHG 🤷🏼,2,bad
"I use android, recently FB took my function bar and put it at the bottom.. now it is the damn way, making a less than friendly experience cause problems with my navigation of the app. They don't even offer a way to put it back at the top with a drag option or another ability to do so... FB is more worried I have a way to make use of applying a cat face filter than something more important..like navigation functionality... It's bad enough they restrict freedom of speech... need i say more...?",1,bad
"I personally think Facebook is all bad from the get go. The continuous tracking and the mass amounts of media we download in a year on Social. BUT there is strong, very quick connection with alot of people at the power of your fingertips, so thats pretty cool so I'm thankful for that. We have the capability to quickly distribute alot of information to alot or people",1,bad
"I get that social media companies want to keep you on the services longer but they have now gone down the same route as supermarkets and removed the clocks from your device screen when you are in app and can no longer monitor your viewing time. And why move the access bar from top to bottom. If it ain't broke don't fix it, like you have done with the content algorithm. 90% of the content is from 3 days ago and seen 20 times.",2,bad
"It was fine until the last update. The whole Facebook dating/friends thing isn't working anymore. I can see the preview of a message from someone, but when I open the chat, nothing shows. I was starting to make some friends and now I can't talk to them because I can't see what they said. Also, every message I send doesn't show either",2,bad
Ever since the latest update that Facebook did here in the Google play store. App either crashes constantly or doesn't even work when tapping on the app. Wait and Wait still doesn't load or open. This is ridiculous. Fix this problem asap. Keep making all of these changes to the app. Can't even use the app. It won't work.,1,bad
"They remove more and more of your ability to control your page each day and undo your settings. Now the notifications are on the bottom and disappear if you scroll and it no longer allows you to see the top of your phone screen in order to tell the time or check your battery life. Facebook just gets more ghetto every day. Still can't set your Facebook to show new posts first, opting instead for repeating the same 10-15 posts up to a week back every time you reload the home page.",1,bad
"Facebook is now ruined. What was meant to be a connection to friends and family is now all ads or sale items. You've accomplished what you intended, but this new layout and having to search for posts is unnecessary. You should have left it a combo of ads, posts, pages, groups, etc. This is too much work now. Scrolling by has now gone to not even logging on. Stop changing things.",1,bad
I log in and as soon as my timeline shows the app closes. I go to open the app again and it logs me out. When I do log in the app runs slow and doesn't load everything. I have tried all troubleshooting and it's still not working properly. Now it won't let me log in at all. It keeps closing me out. This is frustrating,1,bad
"Works okay usually, except when it doesn't. Trying to scroll through and like all birthday greetings is very buggy and, this year, downright impossible after the first 8 greetings. It keeps jumping back up to the 8th greeting, even after liking 5 or 6 more after it. Then suddenly they're all unliked again. App also must be force-closed... no backing out. Recommend the PC web version for everything else besides casual scrolling.",3,neutral
"horrible app, full of issues. unlike on ios the buttons (home, etc..) are above feed beyond reach of thumb on all current phones on sale. also facebook removes the ability to read messages without another app (fb messenger). inviting friends to events hard and event calendar usability is a disgrace. The fb feed keeps suggesting watch-bait rubbish I don't want to see even that I've chosen repeatedly don't want to see this anymore.",1,bad
"This app isn't opening anymore when I run it from the SD card. It used to work until this latest update. The dots on the loading screen are flashing, but that's it. I'm running it from the SD card because the app is so large. I don't want it using all of my phone space so I don't want to run it from the phone.",1,bad
I imagine the last update is the culprit but you can no longer see your matches chat response in Dating. It's not just on my end as others are experiencing it too. I won't hold my breath on it getting fixed. I maybe just awefulizing here but any attention they give this app usually results in 2 steps forward and 6 steps back. It's a bloated behemoth with too much going on. A simple suggestion is to allocate options to use Facebook dating in an external app of it's own. Ok rant over. Will update,1,bad
A partially nightmare on a foldable device... Every time I open or close my Samsung Galaxy Fold5 the Facebook app looses the context (leaves the page/position that I am currently watching) and switches back to the start page... this is ridiculous! 😡 It also often doesn't resize videos after closing the device. Shame on you FB developers... 😐,1,bad
"My page was hacked. I gained back my page access by the help of meta support team. They helped me cordially. But after gaining back my access I found that my page is restricted to advertise.

Each time they telling me my issue will be solved shortly, internal team is looking about the issue. But no update at all after almost 1 year.",1,bad
Absolutely and totally useless. Do not waste your time! It routinely matches you with people many states away and I have the preferences set to a 20 mi radius. Sometimes it matches me with people in Canada. Listings disappear and you can't get them back. Worst programming and worst dating app I've ever seen.,1,bad
"First they separated my author page without my permission, and ruined the followers I was building, plus I can no longer do ads, now I can't even switch into other accounts. And they make sure you can't reach them to ask them to fix the issues they have caused. I'm sure they think it's funny, but if I could find another platform I'd delete FB in a second. In the last 2yrs,I have been trying to contact someone to fix the issues they caused.",1,bad

"I need the Lock Feature. Newly created Facebook Accounts doesn't have the option anymore. Also, there should have a privacy option in the Featured Photos, users should be able to change the featured privacy from Public to Friends and vice versa anytime.

Another thing, there should have a search option in the comment section so we can look up names easily.",2,neutral

Horrible costumer service or help. My account got hacked 2 nights ago and still have yet to gain any help. The help center is absolutely useless and it never leads to an actual person. I have had an account for almost 20yrs and not an ounce of help when I actually need it. I only want my account back for all my memories and messages or I wouldn't care at all.

Links no longer open in built in browser so there goes click revenue. Drafts don't get saved to my notifications. Updates happen constantky WHILE I AM BROWSING.

Maybe I've said it to too many people and I've reached a quota or something but there used to be a nice and easy box, for me to write a birthday wish on people's birthday, that has disappeared. I can still go through their profile and send a message directly to their wall but that feels a bit intrusive and creepy. So I'm giving this 2 stars. Bring back the birthday box.",2,bad
"Hi, I don't know what is happening but there is a problem with this app, so far it is been so good but then months ago up to now, I can't add music in my stories (new and popular music). it is always the old musics. Can you please fix the issues? thank you.",1,bad
"App stopped working properly on some tabs and deleted entire conversations suddenly on 10/6 then by 10/8 the whole thing is crashing and totally unusable. Switched to FB Lite and it's better but not all features are in that app..hence ""lite"" and the features I wanted are not in that one so....1 star until that's fixed",1,bad
"you keep changing things, and it makes the app worse. I can't watch a reel or video without it stopping and I can't look at news, as it says I'm caught up, that is for both national and local news tabs. Stop trying to be cool and put out an app that works as it should.",1,bad
"When I enter my Facebook ID, after a while the display screen of the mobile goes black. When I press the back button, it gets fine again. After two seconds, it gets black again. I think there is a problem with Facebook's settings or some problem with my ID tools. Please. Please solve this problem I am suffering a lot",1,bad
"Ridiculous that FB runs 10x worse than it did when it was just getting started... I can't even respond to event invites with anything besides ""interested"" or ""going"". The ""not going"" option has entirely disappeared. I just have to ignore the events, and get continuous notifications about them.",1,bad
"Very annoying to use FB on the phone ever since you've moved the navigation bar to the bottom of the screen. Whenever I open the comments of a post, it is a pain to get out of because it keeps opening my keyboard when I try to swipe down to get back to my news feed. Fix it please!",1,bad
THEY COLLECT YOUR DATA EVEN WHEN YOU ARE NOT USING THE APP. They collect every Web page you visit including banking and show your activity on it. They won't even allow me to delete my synced contacts which I allowed by accident. Check all settings and use a pc to do it because you'll find a bunch of data collecting settings that are automatically turned on that are not included in the app information or permissions. Reconsider using any app from this scummy corp & PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY AND DATA,1,good
"I've been using it for long time, it's good though, however, I've been experiencing some bugs/problems about this app like searching for music stories. its sucks when I search for music, it doesn't show up the song I want.I hope you can fix it.",1,neutral
"CAN YOU DO SOMETHING TO FIX MY APP?.. ITS BEEN LOGGING OUT AUTOMATICALLY FOR MANY TIMES IN AN HOUR!!!! LIKE B.!!! ITS EXTREMELY ANNOYING!! een using the app for years.. but these past few months, I noticed that I have to re-log in every minute because the "", Session has expired "" thing annoying me!!

"Facebook beta has gone weird since the last update . Every time I want to click on my uploaded photos, it crashes . It's very annoying !! I've undone the last update, so it's works properly now . I'm never updating Facebook beta again . Just wish I could go back to normal Facebook. And now a new update that crashes every time I click on a reel or video!!! So bloody annoying!!!!!!",2,bad
"Hello! Is it possible to have/see download progress when watching videos on Facebook just like YouTube? Sometimes with bad internet connection, I don't like when it cuts out several times, so I'd like to see the progress to launch the video once and then watch it smoothly till the end. Thank you.",1,good
I think Facebook should remove the dedicated tab for People You May know (very unnecessary to highlight a minor feature) and bring back groups tab. Also it should provide features for users to customize what they want to see more rather than suggesting and forcing content based solely on algrthm. A lot of lessons can be learned from X like their lists features. I think it's time for Facebook to streamline the platform for Professionals as well (have seen a lot of good changes for this but still),3,neutral
"My android continues to get updates 2 to 3 times a month. I also have the app to not do an Auto-Update. But, when I have the app sitting for a few days, it automatically updates itself. I also hate that my business page keeps showing useless pages on my feeds that I have no interest in because it is my business page.",1,bad
The last update is horrible!!! Some of the text is black when it should be white. The ads are really irritating. Facebook has gone downhill with every update. Sometimes if ain't broke don't try to fix it. I've been in this app for years and can honestly say this was the worst update ever.,1,bad
Only app that has multiple instances open in the background. If you go home or back out of it and open it again it adds another rather than opening the previous. Also it does this stupid pop up when you screen shot which makes it so you can't scroll capture. Honestly garbage,1,bad
"Trying to use facebook on my laptop is an absolute waste of time, trying to access my photos is unachievable. Not acceptable at all. All I want to do is upload some photos and videos cause the app is playing havoc with my phone. Surely uploading some pictures and videos shouldnt be this hard!!!",1,bad
"One of the most used apps and one the apps that doesn't work properly. With every new update on the app, you'll see a new issue there. For now, I have a problem that my app says ( on my account ) session expired. As long as I tried to reinstall it and many other ways that I tried. It didn't work for me. After using the Facebook app for 12 to 13 years.",3,bad
"Apparently the two factor authentication system is useless 🥺. The way I've been hacked is so heartbreaking. Out of the blue you just receive emails that someone change you e-mails and your login details. The recovery option of sending your ID document, they keep saying your picture is blurry. The camera quality of my s21 Fe🤔 and they telle it's blurry.",1,bad
"The app won't load at all....it stays on the Facebook page with the loading dots. I can log in via my browser, but I can't get the app to work at all. I have tried reporting it, but that option only comes up occasionally and they are apparently ignoring it",1,bad
"Unbearable amount of ads and spam! And if no ads, then FB spams with ""suggestions""! Stories of people I don't know and do not wish to know, the frequent demand to support business in my area (even hiding makes it not less frequent), notifications and reactions are being delivered with a noisy PLING even it's set on silent/no sound... reporting these issues is not being addressed in weeks. AND the app consumes a hilarious amount of storage, several GB!!! 👎",2,bad
"I used to really enjoy the dating feature but it's been bugging out and every time I get a message and try to open the conversation, the whole conversation is gone, it seems like other people are getting my messages but I can't read any of there's or any of our old conversation, it's just reverts back to how it looks before anyone makes a move. Super irritating because that was my main dating app.",1,bad
"Why exactly the shortcuts are still at the top of the screen instead of the bottom. Pleaaaaaase, phones are huge and my fingers aren't that long. And no, swiping left or right isn't good, I need to make 4 swipes just to see my notifications. Please just put the shortcuts at the bottom, we are on 2023.",2,bad
"Haven't received push notifications for about 6 months now. Tablet version doesn't have dark mode. Everything that Facebook says to get notifications to doesn't work because everything has been on since it was set up. It doesn't matter what device I use Phone A, Phone B, Tablet A, Tablet B notifications do not work.",1,bad
"I wish I could give this app 0 rating. It's extremely invasive with ads and recommended trash I don't care about. Lately it's gone worse and worse, giving me suggested ""TikTok-like"" videos. 3rd party apps don't have suggested content and ads that show up literally every second post. And also don't hide posts from friends I interact less with. I got fed up, uninstalled it and downloaded a 3rd party app. And now they get a bad review.",1,bad
"Always updating the wrong things... I have Samsung, and for the past 2 years, my experience using the Facebook app is getting worse and WORSE. When I go to the comments section, it makes my keyboard pop up, and when I try to exit out 1x- 2x, it makes the comments glitch or makes me completely exit out of the comments. It's so annoying. This is why I left Facebook 4 months ago. Every time I come back, there's something failing to piss me off. No customer support from a billion $ company.",1,bad
"Can't control the videos,,,, can't read a status without having a fear that it would be lost... and this annoying ads that start before a video I can't take it.. I left using YouTube app only because of these ads... now it's happening in Facebook also.... Please change the application like the way it was before.....",2,bad
Recently my experience was good... But now whenever I'm trying to search any song.. It's showing like no results found... And in reccomendations only english songs are shown... This problem is not only faced by me.. i saw many people facing the same problem... I've cleared my cache my data...but still can't get rid of it...Please fix this problem.. Now I'm really furious,2,bad
"Free Palestine Ads and eavesdropping are out of control! I see more ads than I do my friends' posts in my news feed. I'm also disgusted by the targeted ads. No matter what settings I turn off in the app, and in my phone, I see links for topics that have been brought up in the general vicinity of my phone. Some are truly inappropriate, or highly sensitive things I don't wish to see. I hide/block/report them all, and they still show up. I'm over it and likely uninstalling soon.",1,bad
"I think there's a bug or issue with the text section of the Facebook story. I can't add a long text on my story without it being trimmed or cropped like a photo. Sometimes it just totally disappears. Please help us fix it so we can resume posting texts on our stories again, thanks.",2,bad
"Honestly I don't understand Facebook anymore like how do you add a new feature for people to make another profile and don't give it to everyone else ( it should be given to everyone else and only one should be made only) And why do you sometimes keep taking away the music feature let alone the pinned music features , it's suppose to make our profile or profiles look cool and organized to our personalities, honestly get that stuff fixed because it's honestly annoying to have it..",1,bad
"So why is it that when I set my notification preferences a certain way, you guys always change it back? Why would you even offer to let me do so if you guys are gonna change it back every time? Why does your app keep showing me dating notifications that dont exist? It'll say I have 3 or 4 notifications, but when I tap on that, there's literally not a single new thing to see. why does dating keep showing me people from states that are extremely far away? after i set my preferences a certain way?",1,bad
There is a lot of inconsistency with thia app. Someone has the navigation bar at the bottom and some at the top. There are no option to choose between the two. Please fix thia abnormal inconsistencies that varies from one account to another.,1,bad
Comments are erased if you go to another app temporarily. Can't select photos to complete form to list item on marketplace. Wish I could actually see the thing I was commenting on when writing comments. I'm afraid to look at details of posts because the feed will randomly refresh and I won't be able to find it again. Finding my own past posts is very difficult.,1,bad
"The app is constantly logging me off seconds after opening, or after scrolling past one or two posts. It has become a very frustrating experience, especially when trying to communicate with people or making events. It shouldn't have to be this way.",1,bad
"I use facebook to make plans for events with groups and friends. Facebook has, recently, stopped showing posts from friends, groups I am in, and pages I follow after about 2 minutes of scrolling. It has replaced these with Suggested for You posts from people I do not follow, or have any interest in seeing. There is no way to change this in settings, and it prevents me from using facebook to connect with friends and organize events, as it stops showing posts from my friends altogether",1,bad
"I have a state of the art phone but the app still acts weird. I don't receive notifications most of the time, even though I checked my phone settings a billion times. I sometimes can't message people because the message button doesn't work unless pressed 2000 times. What's going on with the app?",1,neutral
"It's become borderline unusable. I'm primarily using Facebook for Marketplace in my local area and almost all the listings I see are out of area shipping, my for you page almost only shows me stuff available for shipping or outside of area. The ads are what? 1/2 the posts at this point? I'll be switching to another app, this has become ridiculously bad",1,bad
"Facebook please fix this problem. Recently I've not been able to add any popular local music of mine. So far I've been seeing music I'm not fond of such as western music, Hispanic music from artists I've never heard of. And when I've tried to search artists I want to add my music from (Taylor Swift, Beabadobee, Rex orange county) there's no results. My app is bugged because my friends don't have this same problem, only I do. Please fix this asap!!",2,bad

Even when I try to show a close up photo of some things for somebody to see That my face is old and wrinkly and not perfect by any means, facebook takes it upon itself to completely erase my wrinkles!!! There is no way to turn it off!!! The suggestions don't work",2,bad
My music selection for stories is all of a sudden limited. It's only pulling up music I've never heard of or played. None of the artist I've been searching for is showing...Even Beyonce music isn't showing up. I hope they fix this issue,1,bad
Closed 18 ads and posts from pages I've never followed before I got to the first post from someone who was actually on my friends list. Ads are horrible. Literally porn showing up on my feed and everything else is clothing calling to overthrow the government.

Latest update made it so all your functions are on the bottom right where all your phone functions are (Home) (Open Apps) and the (Back Button) seriously how long you guys been at this and you didn't think putting the notifications and everything else on Facebook would be impossible to use when the dedicated phone buttons are there....,1,bad
I have Facebook because all my friends are on Facebook and I want to keep up with them. But here's a major gripe. Why is it that I can use Gboard microphone dictation to ride out this review or to write out a comment on any app except Facebook which overrides my microphone to suggest something I can autocomplete by clicking. That should have nothing to do with dictation. Cut it out Facebook.,1,bad
"Very bad social media application. They stated that this platform can freely use Express Speaker. But when we upload or say something, something is rarely a natural sound. Sometimes account restrictions are imposed. And account monetization is stopped. But we do not violate anything.

What is this oh!",1,bad
I'm unable to give you a rating (1 star to post my comment) as my Facebook keeps crashing after an update is done. This only happens when I would like to watch a movie. I have installed and uninstalled it. I don't know how many times after an update.,1,bad
"Since the last app update, I am now unable to open any articles and reels open with audio but no visuals. I am unable to sort posts in groups by most recent and, where there are multiple comments on a post, clicking ""previous comments"" does nothing. Facebook is now virtually unusable",2,bad
"When you click on a notification for when someone likes your comment, it doesn't bring you to that comment. Also, you can't scroll back to 0 seconds on a video. It has been years. This app is so bad. This app will not stop giving me notifications from groups I blocked ad well. So bad.",1,bad
Every update is a change is something. We never have any Choices. Such a simple idea to give people a choice of navigation bar on top of bottom of the screen. (As example) probably would have more than 3 star rating if we ask had Choices if you'd changes,1,neutral
"After latest update of Facebook app, it has messed up my Messenger app: 1. Am constantly kicked out of Picture in Picture on Messenger 2. Get strange double notifications for every message, saying ""hidden content"" despite my notifications from the app being blocked in settings 3. Messenger is INCREDIBLY slow.

The notification section is way messed up. At the top are days and even weeks old notifications and I have to scroll way down to get current notifications. Now on top of everything the app either won't open or it force closes 70 percent of the time if not more. If this is fixed I will give more stars,1,bad

Gee this is getting worse as the days go by. I can't watch a video properly it's juddering or there's no sound and I know there's should be or is it like the TV show lip sync. Then no notifications then my phone was sending me alerts that were real or ghost ones which were annoying. Now I'm getting none. Seriously it needs looking at,1,bad

FYI guys. This version does not sync any user data. When u login theres no friends or custom feed. Tried on three phones same thing. Instead I logged in via chrome (all friends and feed normal) and made a shortcut to the main screen and use that instead. You need to fix your app.,1,bad
Open links externally keeps being disabled. You're in app browser is horrible. The option to open links externally keeps being removed or doesn't actually work. And now it only allows using opening links externally in messenger even though the setting is on the main app. Just make it work.,1,bad
"Toxic UX with dark patterns such as disabling the back button, showing third party accounts even after stating not interested and a timeline that is more about things I don't care than people I care. Oh, and I never gave permissions to the app to scan my contacts and it did it anyways.",1,bad
9/7/23 Most recent android update has created a whole new bunch of problems. Moving the navigation bar from the top to the bottom is terrible and for some reason this app is now concealing the status bar on my phone. I have to work harder just to see what time it is.,1,bad
"Facebook new video tab is horrible,cropped video, can't fast forward, annoying text and icon overlay the video. Don't push to be like other app video style. Watching video is unjoyable. Bring back the old video style, or create something different that is better.",1,bad
"Edit: I have tried contacting customer service, there is NONE. You cannot contact FB. The app barely works. Good job, FB. You just keep getting worse. I keep getting a ""Session Expired"" message and get logged out like 10 times a day! What is this?? Seriously, FB, DO BETTER!!! Also, the ads and ""suggested for you"" posts have taken over. I rarely see posts made by my own friends or family. Absolutely ridiculous.",1,bad
I'm not able to tag people ever since the update. Im still having the same problem even though you guys just did another update. When you go to tag people it turns blue after you click on them but then after you start typing the message the person's name turns black like your text.,1,bad

No support because there is no email contact for help, so fun...",1,bad

New phone new download.. so when were pop up ads put in on Facebook videos. It's annoying to say the least. And answers the question of why the video player wasn't working the pop up ads wasn't registering leaving it in a endless loop of buffering. And what dose it say that even Google thinks pop up ads are stupid.,1,bad
"Absolute garbage at this point. Why the hell do I need a separate app that takes up a lot more space to even VIEW my messages? Also extremely un-user friendly if you need to change settings. They will hide the explanations of what information they are selling of yours so you cannot find out, but they can still legally say they told you. Just another flaw. I could go on for days. Basically what you need to know if you have to have 2 apps: 1 for basic scrolling/marketplace and the other to see msg",1,bad
The in-app web browser really sucks. Can't even implement a decent in-app web browser as a basic requirement. My god.

I am deleting it. I could write a rant of why I hate it...but the reviews only let me write 500 characters and my problems with this app won't even start there. If you download it, expect to be irritated and do not expect anything to work. Ever. Especially when you need it.",1,bad

For some reason they made the decision to make Reels cut to the cover image instead of pausing on the videos so you can read it.

"It keeps crashing everytime i open the app. Cleared cache, uninstalled and installed, device restart. Tried multiple time. Nothing works",1,bad
"The back button is no longer working. Have to use the Facebook back arrow. I updated all my apps, and it still doesn't. Very inconvenient.",2,bad
The default setting plays multiple videos in a post simultaneously. Hate listening to other video's audio while playing the other video in a post.,1,bad
It won't load comments and keep saying to connect to internet but my other apps work just fine. Also the videos won't load on it's own. It will freeze until I go to the next one then come back to it.,1,neutral
"Facebook is working fine now. Glitch has been resolved. I don't know why they mess with a perfectly fine app. They are always doing something. And about 2-3 times a year, what they do screws up the app for a week or so.",5,good
"Facebook sucks overall when it comes to business. How does a billion dollar company doesn't have customer service to help business accounts. My business manager page was hacked, so the took control over my Facebook business page as well. Before you could at least chat with someone to help you out. now that opinión doesn't even work anymore. they like when you spend thousands of dollars, but they don't help you out at all if you have an issue. I need help recovering my business manager page.",1,bad
"It is supposed to be a social networking program between people and has freedom of expression...but this does not exist due to political trends and biases through the application...from preventing videos or pictures or publishing anything that differs in opinion with makers and developers .. but this is not supposed to happen. A platform with people from all over the world with political and religious differences, but bias towards a specific side is disgraceful. I rate this app with zero",1,bad
The fact I can't use the back button on my phone and I have to use the one in the app is making me want to delete it!! Bring back the ability to use the back button....this was a dumb idea for whoever thought of it should be fired. If I could give it a zero star I would HATE this,1,bad
"Days and weeks old posts showing non stop instead of up to date posts. ""Hide ad"" tool completely useless, much like the rest of the app. Then to add insult to all injuries, you take away my ability to use a damn back button!!!! Trying to make yourselves as pathetic as X???",1,bad
"Glitch after bug after glitch after bug. One of the biggest social media companies owning one of the buggiest app and website. Who would have thought when you outsource all your developers and pay them low wages that they would create buggy and inconsistent code. There hasnt been 1 app update where there wasnt some major bug. The most recent bug in the newest update? Opening and reading comments. The filtering of comments for ""most relevant"" is the most brain dead feature. And it doesnt work",1,bad
Constant video ads. Cannot watch any videos without tons and tons of ads. 80% of what I see are also suggested posts and hardly anything relevant. Sad to see it all go down the drain.,1,bad
"Fac When Facebook opens the video, it comes back in color, the display is not coming, it is very difficult to watch the videos, only the voice is coming, the display is black, this problem is coming from four five days.",3,bad

Facebook community is very large community. It enhances linkage between people with different backgrounds accros the globe so that exchange of experiences can be shared among them. I really enjoy the app for it enables me to get connected to the world and allow me to air my opinion on various issues and matters.,5,good
"Bullying and harassment seem to no longer be addressed. They do not take anything including threats into consideration at all. It's an awful app and supports awful things. The back button as stated many times does not work. Sometimes it freezes. And sometimes the images don't even show, just Grey squares. If someone ends their life over the bullying and harassment, then would they take that stuff seriously? No, probably not. Horrible app, horrible horrible.",1,bad

Inferior algorithm. Keeps showing the same news feed and posts from weeks ago. Unreliable fact checking. Keeps deleting posts and pages that they didn't like. They also allow scammers to impersonate other people. Easy for hackers to hack and very hard to restore accounts.,1,bad
At the moment...my app keeps crashing and I can't report it because there's no notification to send it. I be scrolling or I am mid way thru a video and it closes. My phone it'd self is updated and I have turned it on n off.,1,bad
"As for the app, it's poorly optimized. And as for the company's practices, it's sad that they've been able to dominate the market, making the app a necessity as means of communication. It's time to make a change and end the era of Facebook. The ad says - the world is on Facebook. No, it's quite the opposite - it takes the world away from you",1,bad
"It is a horrible app. It is buggy, that is one thing, I always get glitches with photo uploads, and posts, the upload stucks and for days it says that I should upload my post or discard it, but it already posted... But my biggest issue is with paid promotions, you can literally promote anything if you have money. I see advertisements goes against facebook's own community standards every day, every f. day. Facebook should be fined soo heavily for this. And the marketplace is full of scammers.",1,bad
Back button on Android not working anymore RIGHT after update. Can't be anything else. I have newest android and newest Google Plus phone. Should work fine. Back button in app itself does work but at top so annoying to use.,2,bad
Something in the last update completely disabled my back button from working. Absolutely no other app does this. I hit back and it just won't do anything. I have to completely close out of the app,1,bad
"Why is it that when you view a notification and then think later to revisit it, it's no longer listed so you have to hunt it down? I now also see that the Dark theme has stopped working with black text on the dark background so I've had to go back to light.",3,bad
"Absolutely frustrated with this app. Full of adds everywhere. They are making heaps of money from us, but when it comes to get help, they do nothing. My mum's page, where she has been running her business since 2010, was hacked and taken by an Asian company. All of her pictures have gone. Tried to report this many times, no way to contact anyone, and their help page is useless! I have reported the now stolen page as scam, still nothing happen!!

Not good. 0/5 I don't know what genius decided to dump the majority of Meta's cash into a trashy digital world that a total of 13 members, but, they did that, and it seems like they completely gave up on Facebook. SOOOO many bugs, incessantly repetitive ads for stupid reels they want you to make (I've been getting the same one for probably 3 months+. Ask me how fun it is to hear that song every single day). Get yourself and your friends into a newer social app.",1,bad

"The original purpose and idea of Facebook's creation was beautiful and extremely innovative. Unfortunately due to the continuous downward spiral of societies values, morals, intelligences,& etc. Most social media platforms are now used for all the wrong reasons! They are now flooded with scammers, hackers & much more that isn't safe, nor is it conducive to anyone that uses the app! Ridiculously horrible to what it is now! Due to the negative history! Install/Unistall should be an option!",1,bad
"Can't turn on professional mode There is no option so that's irritating. I reported a problem but nothing has been done. I go to FB jail often for ridiculous reasons. Your censored well, some of us are. I've been using FB since it began and the last couple of years it's been more frustrating to use.",3,bad
So the newest update made my phone back button no longer work. Now to go back from comments etc I have to touch the upper left part of my screen to use the Facebook back button. This is annoying as heck!,2,bad

I have to download the video twice so I can put it my story ... I hope you understand my english.. Anyways can you somehow fix this?",3,good
"When I select the comment tab, the keyboard is triggered to appear automatically. Typically, to dismiss the keyboard and read the comments, one would press the back button, which should hide the keyboard. However, in this case, the keyboard reappears even after pressing the back button, necessitating multiple attempts to conceal the keyboard interface. Clear this issue ASAP !!",1,bad
Marketplace problem. Today i can't get any new listins there and there is no way of fixing it since the only thing it lets me do is change location and that made it even worse. I like this app but i need to fix this quick so for the moment is 3/5.,3,neutral

"Idk what happen but all of my pictures, memories, basically complete timeline has disappeared.....really considering removing my account.....seems to be more of an advertisement and promotion app now not social networking or connecting with old friends....Im not sure I feel comfortable with this app having capabilities to access my device any longer. ads are taken over and may be causing viruses or allowing hackers to gain access to my information",2,bad

Same posts from 4 days ago keep showing up but nothing new after the update. Glitchy notifications as well. The app basically has a mind of its own and is too stubborn to work with you.,2,bad

I can only post pictures and that's it. Even videos for my day is impossible. How can I continue with this app now?",2,bad
I have been using Facebook for a long a time now and there were really a lot of bugs that I tried to report it but nothing happens. One of it was not having the layout option when uploading photos. It works on other accounts but it doesn't work in one of my accounts it's really annoying because I reported this problem a lot of times but nothing happened. Now is the restriction ban. My account got restricted for just sharing 2-3 post and I don't interact with my account that much. PLEASE FIX THIS,2,bad

Used to be good. The UI is slightly different depending o what device I'm using(all android) eve though I keep up to date with the updates. Seems slow and bogged down. Using marketplace has become slow and tedious. And last it takes up way to much space. Step up Meta,2,neutral
Deserved negative rating because this app has been spamming me with lots of celebrity posts or video reals on my feeds even though I don't really follow them. I tried blocking those and clicking see less but it keeps coming back. Look facebook I don't care about celebrities or other useless posts. I just want the old facebook back where it just shows all my friend's post not just those useless celebrity gossips.. it so toxic and it's becoming a gossip magazine.. please just fix this app!!,1,bad

The app worked fine. It was when they decided if something was not to be on or not and they don't show you what the reprimanding you for so you have to. Agree to it or disagree but they win in Facebook jail 7 times. For saying that other people posted somebody was out to get me and turn me in which I think is ridiculous end of story,1,neutral
"For some reason I don't get notifications on comments anymore. It's quite impossible to catch up with anything. So annoying. And the app doesn't respond to other settings I make. No luck on the phone app settings either. And please remove all the ""suggestions"" in my feed. It's spam!",1,bad

To many Facebook ads. Every 3rd to 4th post is another unwanted ad. I've tried to block all my personal information and clear all of my ad interest but nothing works to block getting stupid ads.

Latest update has bugs. I cannot back out of comments to the neswfeed after clicking on notifications. It also doesn't load up the page where i commented when replying.

Using AI to hide news about Palestinian suffering is crossing the line. The suffering on both sides is abominable but to highlight one over the other shows how morally bankrupt Facebook is just like the leaders of countries who are more interested in power play than their own citizens.

BACK BUTTON DOESN'T WORK WITH APP ANYMORE IN NOTIFICATIONS: Aside from all these other liberal dingbat ideas This is probably one of Facebook stupidest moves by far. There are more Android users than iPhone users yet they make this to where you can't use your back button on the Android device in order to back up in the notifications. Fix it!,1,bad
"The feed is extreemly zoomed, therefore the image appears much too big very difficult to see. It's like having it too close to your face. Also the screen does not rotate to vertical mode. I also hate very much the fact that my tablet system is set in phone mode. In the past, you could see the feed on the left side and on the right, you'd see the friend list of who was on messenger. Please can you fix that if possile? I d'like to be able to use my tablet as a tablet and NOT a phone. Thank you.",1,bad
"All messages in dating have disappeared. The matches and conversations are all there but when I get inside the conversation I can't see any message. Even if I send a new one, get out of the conversation and back in, it is not showing up 😞",1,bad
"The story contains errors. The screen became small when I opened the story, and I can't pause the reels, and when I open the comments, I can't hide the keyboard, no matter how much I try to hide it, it appears again I changed the keyboard and the problem remains the same",2,bad
"Between getting temp banned whenever I defended my right to exist and the excessive number of ads for it I get elsewhere, if I could go back in time and prevent its existence, I would. Literally getting a 1-star because of ads with such tiny close buttons, you open this page 90 times, and I wish i could block Facebook forever. 🖕",1,bad
"Far too many ads and unwanted notifications. There's more suggested pages and ads than posts from my own friends and followed groups. I've turned off practically every push notification yet I'm being bombarded with 'suggested group' push messages. Most of them inappropriate, usually sexual in nature and if you report them, they apparently don't go against community standards. What used to be a decent app, has gone to the dogs since it became part of meta.",2,bad
"This application works to spread racism and distort freedom of opinion. It is no longer suitable for use at all. There are competing platforms that are much better than it. This application supports the killing of firefighters and civilians. In the end, it is no longer suitable for anything. I advise everyone to delete this application from their phone.",1,bad
Well I've been plugged into Facebook for well over 10 years and while there are ups and downs the overall value is still top-notch. The back button on androids could be fixed though,5,good
"Give me back the use of my back button! Not being able to use it makes using this app even more frustrating, on top of the constantly annoying ""suggested posts,"" when I'm not even seeing posts from pages I actually follow in favor of those.",1,bad
"Since Facebook updated I can't use the back button on my phone like I was able to couple days ago, and I can't see my notifications unless I go into notifications and refresh and then I see all my notifications.",1,bad
A couple days ago my Facebook account was hacked. Within 30 seconds they had changed my email address and they have changed my password so everything that I have tried to do or on your website and your helps in tutorials and all that have tried to do won't let me go past the point of the login page where it wants to verify my email or put in a password. And then ask if it's me or not and of course it is but if I click it it's going to go to the email account that they changed it to.,1,bad
Facebook terrify me when I write some words. Normal words that doesn't harm any one. Facebook closed many pages I made. Their support has become non listener not like before meta. When it close your group with strange reasons. And when you appeal for more than 2 years and group still closed. Very bad policy for Facebook.,1,bad
"My account has been hacked, email and password changed, the lot!I cannot recover it any way at all, and it won't let me create a new account with a different email address! Absolute shambles of an app!!!",1,bad
"The has something wrong with my feed, I keep having updates about things I'm not interested in, the reel s sometimes disappear from my page when I scroll down, I believe it's no longer as it once was.",1,neutral
"New updates are sucks. Back button are not working any whare in facebook. Any video after open, can't getting back by pressing back button. In every updates, facebook mess up with their app. Its really dissapointing",1,bad
Facebook app. It's very good. Easy to use. Easy to find stuff on. Easy to talk to your friends. Lots of reviews. Lots of people hack other people on there. Security could be better makes your phones go slower sometimes. And also the internet connections aren't that great so it keeps stopping every now and then but it might be my phone. Not quite sure could be your G4. I don't know but it is good. I enjoy it. Go on there a lot. Chat with my friends. Very good,5,good
"Updated 10\27\23: Constantly crashing on tablet and asking for log in, again and again. Ah, no. _____________________ I use Android on tablet but mostly PC. On the puter, I see tons of things, everything is easy to find and there are options. This app, is dumbed down and ridiculous.",2,bad
"All of a sudden, I can't respond to events the normal way. I had an event Friday I was able to confirm for ONLY through email. Going directly in the event to confirm or deny is no longer an option, as it won't appear at all. I have another event coming up soon I was invited to and once again can't confirm to RSVP for it.",1,bad
I live the app marketplace is excellent rarely have i had any problems getting exactly what i needed at reasonable prices peole even came and dropped off stuff for a couple extra dollars. Messaging and searching are quick and easy. All and all a very great app.,4,good
"keeps saying I have no internet connection but literally every other app on my phone works. Also having a problem with the back button, quizzes freeze up, and messenger isn't working properly either.",1,bad
Now the back button on my phone does not make the app go back and now have to use the arrow at the top left making the app need two hands to use. Quality user experience. Infuriating 👍,1,bad
The UI in this new update is awkward with selections of finding profile settings that is hidden. You need to do a few clicks and found nothing. This somehow hampered the UX overall.,1,bad
I've tried everything to get rid of Farmville memories. They show up blank when I hit delete it says cannot be deleted. Really I haven't played in over ten years and now I have to delete all memories forever. Please fix I shouldn't be penalized for playing Farmville years ago. Stupid Facebook,1,bad
"It has too many option but the reporter can't explain the actual problem. I think you should add an explaination box for a report to further understand the given problem, because sometime even though i choose the specific problem, some staff still don't understand everything and ignore the report. For example, bullying sometime meta don't consider it as a bullying cuz they didn't review it properly or sometime there's a hidden logic that meta don't understand. So allow us to explain the report.",2,neutral
I don't know what's up with Facebook but when I'm scrolling through reels it starts playing music until I force close the app. I thought maybe it's my phone but my lil bro is having the same problem. It's annoying can you fix it,1,bad
"Overall good experience, only thing with the latest update is that the app keeps asking for notifications to turn it off or on Even after I've turned off all the notifications in the app and in the system app area also.",3,good
"1=(mute due to copyright claim) that's stupid 😒 2=Can't go live, Facebook immediately black me because Facebook say that the background music belong to somebody else... Okay then what music are made for?!!! + I can't ad a music to my facebook story I updated the app and everything but still isn't working So sad 3= something went wrong please try again (no avatar)",1,bad
Still not getting birthday notifications now I'm getting notifications from days ago that I already saw saying they happened a few hours ago. Also now some videos have 0 sound and they should. Turned volume up and made sure it was unmited. 0 sound oh and if you lose an account there's no way to contact meta. -10 from me,1,bad
"Flooded with ads, every end of each video I get an error message saying ""Thanks for watching. This ad helps support"" then flooded with ads after every video! What a complete useless app! Mark Zuckerberg is a complete dirtbag and slumlord. Oh and Zuckerberg constantly self refreshes when your on Facebook for too long!",1,bad
"In addition to all the ways they take your personal data & lie about how they use it, their app stinks. The only place you can review sellers on Marketplace is on the app, it's difficult to stop people who create fake profiles & their UI/UX sucks. I have a android tablet with keyboard, when I type a post, it rotates to portrait, even though everything else was in landscape. there is a reason the founder of whatsapp left early b/c money wasn't worth all the bad things this company does.",1,bad
"Its OK... Don't have any real problems with the feeds.. But the dating section has basically stopped working. You can swipe all you want, but when I chat with someone, all the messages are gone like wevw just opened a new chat. Irritated that you can't talk to someone on the platform. I've had to move to other platforms to communicate with people.",2,neutral
"This is getting ridiculous. Ive already submitted multiple videos of myself to verify my account, changed the email linked to my account and asked for your online CS to address the fact that I CANNOT ACCESS MY OLD CREDIT CARD. SO PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO GET MY ACCOUNT UNLOCKED! YOU DONT SEEM TO ALLOW ANY REAL PERSONNEL TO ADDRESS MY ISSUE.",1,bad
"I've experienced a complete take over by someone not allowing to gain or keep friends to share with. I've been treated pretty much unfairly. I can say,that was really good. Next thing I know I receive a community standard violation....not even an explanation. Cause there is no reason . I've tried to receive assistance from Facebook...same old BS!!!",1,bad
"Some bad/dirty things are coming on my Facebook like pictures, videos etc. So, I want to remove them. Please check it and next they not come on my Facebook and also clear them fromy app. And humbley it is serious request to you that these bad/dirty pictures, videos etc may reason or cause of home relationships.... THANKS FOR IT....",2,bad
"good day! please fix the streaming platform, whenever I full screen on my mobile device it didn't fit my screen, sometimes just half like its cropped. I always need to restart the app to be able to fix the resolution please fix this",2,neutral

Too many and too long unskippable ads worse than Youtube. Greedy App. I just skip the rest of the video instead of watching the ads. Very bad experience.,1,bad
"Stopped working as of today. Looked at everyone else's reviews too. Nothing but bad reviews. This is on it's way below 3 stars which is terrible. Not sure if it's due to a update or not but on s23 ultra with great wifi/internet and all other apps working just fine. Tryed deleting and reinstalling the app, reset it, cleared cache and restarted phone. To no avail. App just force closes. Also most of the recent 5 star reviews are fake, you can tell by looking at them. Straight up bots.",1,neutral
"I wish it was a lot easier to find out what my email is. Facebook also sucks. If you end up getting hacked, and you use a third-party authentication app, you're never getting your account back if you delete your Facebook off of your third- party authentication app. I can't get my Facebook back, because I deleted it off of my third-party authenticator. It doesn't do any good to get a recovery code, because I have been signed out of everywhere I signed in. Now I need a stupid login code.",3,bad
"I had hopes for this platform. I invested a lot on ads, I upload constantly, I have contacted several times and message reporting my concerns. I am still on the same spot or just worst. Once an ad stops, it completly obliterate your reach. The ads don't add to your views for monetization. I had a dream of becoming know and recover my investment, but is not working. They told me if I want a look alike audience i need to invest on an ad for a niche. $1.5k invested is not enough? Is unfair.",1,bad
So I can't get in to my profile and I have tried everything. The only device I ever used to log into my account blacked out and I lost access to most everything. I was verified at one point so because of that Facebook made me turn on two factor authentication and because of that I can't use my account. I have verified my identity at least 4 times and I got an email saying my account was unlocked but it's not. It's going on 2 months since I have been able to use my account.,1,bad
"I'll appreciate it if there's a possibility of replaying reels from any desired point and not wait until it plays to the end, then begin again before it gets to the point I would have loved to replay. It's frustrating. Please make it possible to play reels at specific desired points. Best regards Facebook team.",4,bad
"Stupid update, it wasn't like this before but now the only way to go back after opening up a Facebook post is by pressing the back button from the app itself, the phone's back button is no longer usable after the latest update",3,bad
"Although it's a great tool for communication, it is a source for millions to stay updated with current events, which has been painstakingly bias. It hinges freedom of speech through censorship and amplifies one-sided perceptions.",1,good
"I dislike the new update so much, the copyright standards are extremely severe that I can't even upload any videos in my story without getting a warning, as if I'm only permitted to use the facebook's music feature, even if i give credits in the captions. The zoom feature for stories aren't in my likings as well since it's annoying adjusting the video I'll be submitting in my story. It grew terrible after the update. The feature album(s) won't pop up to some accounts as well.",1,bad
"Back button no longer working, when I open comments it's ok because there is the back button at the top but when opening videos, I am stuck and no option to go back and I nave to close Facebook, pls fix",1,bad
"It's extremely politically biased and does not encourage freedom of speech from all parties (and I mean legal freedom of speech). The algorithms will always manipulate the reach in favour of certain opinions. Also for no legal reason they blocked my business account permanently and no matter how much I file for appear or I need tech support to tell me why, there's no response.",1,bad
Updates make this app worse all the time. We're now to the point where extremely basic functionality like the BACK BUTTON no longer works. Embarrassing to even run this trash app on my Z Fold 5.,1,bad
"I only use this app to see some news, the content of this app is very biased it only endorses certain content that match a certain agenda, it is not a an open space for freedom of speech, it is definitely a toxic and extremely biased environment.",1,bad
"Account recovery is too unnecessarily complicated. Instead of it preventing people who are not owners of an account from accessing someone's account but it is programmed badly such that an actual Facebook owner is prevented from accessing their own account if they lost their Google 2fa code due to change of device yet still have their email, phone number. Developers must find a solution to this; all their other options of account recovery do not work they just enable an owner to change password.",1,bad
Taking away the ability to use the 'back' button function on Samsung phones is by far one of the dumbest updates you've had. But I can't remember ALL of the idiotic updates that nobody wanted Facebook has done. So currently this is the worst.,2,bad
"I'm basically locked out of my account until I get an ID because no matter how long I wait to get a 2-step verification code, it never comes. This is honest to god the most annoying thing ever.",1,bad
"Not only is the back button issue annoying, once you select it having the feed auto-refresh back to top is becoming especially annoying when viewing Marketplace & rummage page items 🙄",3,bad
"Fix the back button ability. Thats new after the last update. Way too much biased censorship. If they are going to fact-check every post, wouldn't that make them a publisher and not an open forum? Nothing has changed.",1,bad
"After the last update, the app no longer rotates the camera correctly it used to go live with a better landscape orientation it no longer service our needs please can you go back previous live layout",1,bad
"The app has a bug and it just started the other day. I keep on refreshing my account page, and the updated uploads does not show. I cleared the data even uninstalled the app. Now the notifications also does not load. ""Connection error"" But in browser (chrome app), facebook is working. PLEASE FIX THIS! Using Android 13 - Xiaomi 11T Pro Update: the Lite version is working perfectly.",1,bad
"Since the last update, the back button on my device no longer works in the app,which is an incredibly weird ""feature"".",1,bad
"is not letting me post, and keeps reporting any comments as an ""attempt of fraud to gain likes and followers"" keeps saying is ""fixing the problem"" you try to report stolen pages and won't listen!!when the posts went from videos of interviews to all of a sudden naked women, facebook is not paying attention to the issues!!! and is creating extra for its users !!",1,bad
Since screwing with the last 3 updates...the app won't use the back arrow on the phone/Tablet etc to navigate or close the app...if it ain't broke don't friggin fix it!,1,bad
"Facebook has gotten to big for it's boots, unspecified updates, what are they hiding? Every time I look at my page it shows different results, why? It's now full of scammers trying to steal money or identitys yet Facebook do virtually nothing about it but hey post something they don't like and get blocked. Facebook has sadly become a load of bo!!ocks.",1,bad
"Not sure why, but every time I tap on ""comments"" on any post, my keyboard keeps popping up. I close it but it pops back up almost immediately. The only way to stop it is if I'm actively scrolling through the comments, but then I can't read the comments that way, can I? Been happening since the last update.",3,bad
"Everytime I open an external link like from Instagram, when I go back to Facebook it's always session expired so I have to log in again. So annoying.",1,bad
On my Android device I can no longer swipe back from the bottom of my screen. I have to touch the Facebook back arrow to get out of things. That is very annoying.,1,bad
I have been using Facebook a very long time. but the latest story songs won't Pop up. It's only sound tracks. I don't know if my phone has the problem or the app it self please fix this.,2,bad
"I have several friends whose pages have been hacked or duplicated for scams. Reporting posts gets you nowhere. They are very obviously scam posts. Selling a car with comments turned off, inboxing people for money, posting cashapp ""glitches"". All very clear scams that Facebook allows to remain on their platform. Do something about your phishing problem in one of these annoying updates.",2,bad
"Most of the time it works correctly, but I have a Facebook group and the settings are always changing. The Facebook platform is nice because it does have alot of features. I'm a little upset about the way you have to change from my profile to my page profile, I'm finally getting used to it. They make changes quite often as a group Administrator.",3,neutral
"Seems gigantic updates (to gigantic 107.00MB app) 40-80MB happen on a daily basis??? This is killing the app & my phone functionally. It almost looks like a pissing contest ""who can deliver the largest and most disrupting updates...most frequently!!!! G or FB.... Oh yeah....FB it would be so helpful if you would ID the fake profile, ""digital art"" photos of non-existent persons so I don't waste effort interacting with nothing. I can pick out obvious ones, but creators R making them more realistic",3,bad
Lagging and miss behaving when I press back it goes all the way th the homepage not one step only refresh doesn't work properly and sometimes freezes in marketplace and so many issues that I lost count it's really frustrating 😤,2,bad
"Using FB, tried the FB dating side. Contacts pop up but you can't see the messages. Even the ones I write and send. Then spent an hour trying to contact support, even to send a message, can't find any help on any page. Totally useless.",1,bad

"Someone hacked my wife's Facebook account. There appears to be no way for her to regain access. There is no one to contact. All emails regarding this have bounced back. Her friends (many) have used their page to report this, nothing yet. She is blocked from her own account. Someone is reposting our old family photos as well as some business marketing.",1,bad
"I use Facebook ALOT. Mostly Facebook marketplace. Super glitchy, not just on my phone but also on my wife's. Same issues. Marketplace orders buying and selling, has zero support. No one to talk to if you receive a damaged item from marketplace orders. I stopped shipping with Facebook marketplace due to no support and Facebook takes A LONG time to send you your money. I went back to Ebay.",2,bad
Facebook is forrible in itself. Only use FB for messenger and marketplace. Marketplace is the most useless thing ever. Zero ability for filtering searches or having search options. Shows you items that have nothing to do with what your looking for. Can't find ads even if you type exactly what is wrote down for the post. Just horrible but what else can you expect from these people,1,bad
"This app is worse than ever..I can't delete an old email accounts from my personal information settings on Facebook even after I've changed passwords so many times in the past months FB doesn't allow me to. All these apps are connected to Google of course, I shouldn't have to delete all saved passwords either Facebook ,Google play, Instagram or Google play Chrom I've relegated myself all to writing my passwords down on paper.",1,bad
App crashes constantly causes my phone to run slow and malfunction. I haven't been able to use the app in days. My phone recommends I put the app to deep sleep since it crashes so much to keep it running properly. This is awful.,1,bad
The keyboard keeps popping up several times even after closing it 😡 This is very annoying. Solve this problem with a new update The app puts restrictions on people's opinions. It doesn't support the freedom of expressing every one's own views.,1,bad
Used to be a great way to connect and keep in touch. Had become a propaganda tool used to push bias and misinformation regarding virtually every dividing ideology or experience that people are faced with in daily life. Great idea but has stayed far off path and is now too far gone for most benefits to be realized. Violates constitutional rights through censorship and shadowbans. This app has become a political tool only.,1,bad

Why this matters happen frequently? Can you the authority solve this problem?",1,bad
"I would like to see posts from the people I follow, instead I'm bombarded with ads and posts from groups I have no interest in. Also people should not be able to list items in the marketplace as free, but then in the listing they'll have: open to offers or prices for individual items",1,bad
"Major glitches! There are major glitches with all the comments sections. The replies will not load unless you first select ""all comments"". Why isnt that the default? Then the keyboard will not stay backed out of; it'll pop up 4 times in a row, then every time one reacts to another comment it pops up again. Then when we gets a notification for a video, it 9 times out of 10 does not take us to that comment. So whatever our friends...or strangers....are tagging us in or replying to, we'll never see",2,bad
"After New update your system back button won't work. You can't load your old Post like pics, reels, video etc. They're are also not paying your earned money. I have earned few $ by ads revenue but they're not paying me. My payouts are correct everything ok but they will do what they want. This App must be Ban atleast in India.",1,bad
"Since the last Facebook update when you go in to your notifications then hit the back button to get out of it you cannot get out of it and return to news feed so you have to close the app completely and then re open it again,, fix it please",1,bad
"horrible. Freedom of speech and expression doesn't exist. they ""fact check"" everything blocking content they dont agree with, heavily biased, and constant bans with extreme reasoning. again heavily biased. also your back button doesn't work in the app so have fun backtracking and getting out of things",1,bad
I do not want this app and always have had it disabled. However since recently it keeps popping up and draining my data and battery. I can't get rid of it because it won't let me delete it. It's ridiculous.,1,bad

Yet Facebook is still censoring factually correct information without fail if it contradicts the narrative.",1,bad
"My experience with customer service at Facebook has been nothing more than an absolute nightmare. If you ever get hacked, you will see what I mean. There is essentially no customer service. I lost my personal and business accounts and have been living in Facebook hell ever since. I started a new account after receiving no help, and because one person said that it must be another hacker (they didn't know I had started a new account), I was shut down again.",1,bad

Facebook is now AdBook! Section meant to curbe advertising like interests can't be accessed and edited. It just says sorry can't do this right now. Over a week and hundreds of unwanted advertising so this section of FB privacy section doesn't work. So i deleted my FB app and will not use it till you FB fixes this issue. You see i just don't care for your censorship and unwanted advertising. The app has lost it's luster and integrity. Goodbye 👋it's mostly advertising now. Good riddance!,1,bad
The newest update forces you to use the on screen back button and not the one that's on your phone. That's super lame and now requires me to use both hands to scroll Facebook. Super weak.,1,bad
Whatever update you performed does not allow me to switch between pages I manage without the app logging me out then looping so I cannot log back in. I have to uninstall then reinstall. Annoying.,3,bad

I wait a week and check my Facebook to see if I missed anything important, and it instantly closes and forces an update. I will just wait another week. Fix this FB.",2,bad
"It auto adds random disturbing musics to my stories. If I don't delete the auto added song before I post my story and don't check my story later, this disgusting random song will stay there. What's more creepier is the fact that when I upload my stories from Messenger, it doesn't auto add musics, but it does exactly that if I upload stories from Facebook. The one at fault is Facebook and only Facebook. Most of the times the songs are cringy Indian TikTok songs. Fix this, bitchy staffs of FB.",1,bad
Horrible experienced biased social media company. Facebook has made it stands towards Israel in Palestine very clear and that they are on the side of genocide. But that aside Facebook continues its tradition of removing features as improvements or updates. Most recently the back button is now entirely useless causing us to use your back button which I imagine is keeping track of user movement throughout Facebook. Lastly charging eu users to opt out of data collection is so scummy. Char limit.,1,bad
"App frustrates me to no end. Just let me see posts from new to old. How hard is that? Used to be able to, why the change? Your algorithms suck. The app also can't do simple things like remind people about birthdays before the actual birthday. Stupid and constantly buggy.",1,bad

It is 3 days before halloween in 2023. Facebook has stopped login collaborations with almost every app and no longer supports sms on messenger.

New upgraded app is horrible. I want to see what my friends are doing not what is suggested for me from someone I don't have a clue about. Facebook has changed for the worse. It's meant to connect you with people you know. Take a few steps backwards and go back to what is known,1,bad

My account got hacked and getting my account back is basically sending me in circles. I can't get to the back up codes. And with all my pics n stuff pointless to create a new profile.,3,bad
7/19/22 Continuous censorship. Untrue fact checking. And Wayyy to many ads. 11/7/22 All above still true and now can't use my back button on my own phone within this app. 😠,1,bad
Horrible Last Update!! My back button no longer works and it's showing posts from only 3 to 6 days ago. Won't load anyone's recent posts.,2,bad
"New update disables using the back button on device. Uninstalled Facebook app and now using Brave web browser interface to axcess FB, it works much better and less battery drain.",1,bad
"Far too many ads and even when they say they don't use your browsing experience, they obviously do. Feeds are a mess as you can't update the newest posts so keep getting stuff that is weeks old. The so called privacy settings do not do what they say either.",1,bad
I've always given Facebook high rating but now I've been locked out for almost close to a year for somebody else's suspicious on my account and I can't access anything that Facebook has on me no pictures no post no contacts so I can't give that a very high review when I can't even contact them to fix the problem because I can't log in,1,bad
"I don't know why but I keep getting logged out. Keeps saying ""Session Expired, log in again."" I also go to the comments section on a post and the keyboard keeps popping up after I take it down. I guess it's time to switch to X.",1,bad
"I've been getting a glitch when watching the reels / videos. A random image just shows up over the videos in top left corner taking up half the screen - I took a screen recording, where can I send it to?",3,bad
"Tried to clear my cache and data because Facebook was refusing to delete photos I tried to delete several times. Now the app refuses to let me log in because I don't have whatsapp and refuse to use it, and they want a photo of my ID. Meta can shove it, I've had this garbage for 15 years and it's about time to give up on them.",1,bad
"It has become Forcebook rather than Facebook, feeding a frenzy of irrelevant irritating advertisement which can't be hidden. It might be time for Facebook to rest where MySpace and Orkut does.",1,bad
It runs slow and poorly developed. The dating feature has disappeared. Now I can't even post a pic as a response. I have to go too main thread. Look for where I need too respond. Then post a reply. And all these account verifications when my info hasn't changed in forever. Ever.,1,bad
"Only displays 6 marketplace items , will not load anymore. Can't scroll. But using browser on same wifi, loads perfect. You broke your own app. Duh.",1,bad
It is inconvenient that my device's back button no longer works in app. Facebook's back function is so annoying at the top left corner.,1,bad
"Really had bad experiences, because whenever i search some group post it wont load it and said i had a bad internet connection while my wifi was very fast and stable even my other phone, can u pls fix it ASAP",1,bad
"This app has ruined my instagram buisness account, I can't link it to facebook and when I try it , I get ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG"" , I hate this app, nothing works, they don't even send codes to phones, the app is ruined. 2 step verification won't work if I can't receive codes from these miserable company.",1,bad
Sponsored post and comment page are unavailable for me. It's so bad that can't view the discussion in comment and the ads post that have sale promotion. The error have been 2 days now and it's not the update issues. How can I fix this!!!!!!,3,bad
"I love the old version of facebook, uncomplicated, no content, no music copyright, no violations, you are free to post. But now becomes crazy. New facebook there are too many violations, the worst community, because facebook missunderstanding the other words, voilations right away, even if professional mode is not on, music copyright ect ect.",1,bad
"Fb dating is broken currently. Messages with matches are not showing for me This may be a server side problem, since the issue started just a day or two ago and the issue replicates over two different samsung galaxy devices and different app versions",1,bad
I have been constantly getting logged out of my account due to session expired in the app. Sometimes this can happen a few times in a day. It's so annoying!,1,bad
"Having so many problems. Cannot update. Pages while reading vanishes to dark screen. Non stop problem. Keeps going blank, jumps to another page. Cannot read anything! Buffering....",1,bad
"3 years after my 1st review. Marketplace is as bad 3 years ago. SLOW SLOW SLOW. Can't open my listings, can't request reviews from buyers in my profile, it's SO slow and just times out trying to load.",1,bad
"I've been using this app for awhile now but have had difficulties numerous amounts of times with hackers, and Facebook not letting me post certain things while you see others on the app also posting bizarre content just know that I will post about what I want. My family and close friends are all also on this app which is why I highly enjoy using the app but the community guidelines keep saying I can't upload some things, I will post what I like thank you very much just as everyone else also does",3,good
"It's a very poor app, not useful at all. Shows always the issues that they want, we can't a upload everything you want, basically you don't have the freedom to post anything you want. Sham on you Facebook.",1,bad
Currently receiving notifications and news feed of posts from one to three weeks ago. Others are not notified when I go live despite their settings or when I post. Tagging is t working properly. It's beenike this for three weeks now,2,bad
I'm pretty sure my facebook app done an update. For some reason now facebook won't even load and open. Others in that I do like it. I will admit it is getting to the point where there are too many ads.,2,neutral
"Facebook, a platform once known for connectivity, has increasingly exhibited biased and monopolistic tendencies, especially concerning freedom of speech and expression. This monopolistic grip often restricts diverse voices, curtails open dialogue, and selectively polices content.",1,bad
"Instead of using the light/dark mode, there is also a ""color mode"" where it can change the color of the whole app. Ex; interface, changed to brown/pink/blue.. With that update, the app would be more user-friendly! Letting everyone have their preferences in app!!",5,neutral
"I don't know what is going on, but the app is getting worse than better. Videos are glitched, play button disappear and you can't press play. Another annoying aspect is that if you want to play a video it will redirect you to separate player every time. No need for that. Let thf video player be like before And the ads, after every second post there is advertisment. Do you really need that much ads if you have trillion dollar company?",2,bad
"When I play a video, another video gets played, I could hear two different sound of two different videos making it impossible to concentrate on one video.",2,bad
"If I could remove the last star I would. Extremely biased and crooked. Absolutely no freedom of speech what so ever for one side, unrestricted support and propaganda for the other. I've also noticed it's been pushing extremist pages on my feed inciting hateful regionalism especially between Marrocans and Algerians. Even though I've previously never been interested in this content and I also remove these posts when they appear in my feed, but they are persistent in bringing them back.",1,bad
"Facebook is a one sided social media platform. it says that you have freedom of speech but we do not. every time, and when I say every time, i mean every single time I post something about palistine it gets taken down. they try to take it down and shut me up. they say they are with both sides but they are lying. I have 3 post that have already been taken down because it was ""controversial"" when all it said what free palistine. I do not recommend this app at all. please do not download.",1,bad
"After this update it have a lot of bugs 🐞 The new cyber security is so weak because when log out once from Facebook, difficult to log in again and all Facebook users faced these problems. We recommend to Facebook policy to clear these all problems. Very lose app I am going tired to use it.",1,bad
Facebook has broke the back button/gesture. Google should not be allowing updates that break the functionality of Androids core navigation into the Play Store.,1,bad
Marketplace let's you send messages but you can't see conversation. Also videos have no way to rewind or fast forward so if you accidentally swipe and go back you have to start video all over,1,bad
It was a nice experience using Facebook cause I can communicate with my friends even they're afar. And there such no things about lag and some problems it is easy to use.,5,good
I have not been to login into my account after updating. It tells you the app isn't available right now. Kindly work on it.,1,bad
"Pi55ed off at the back button not working. It's REALLY annoying, and a totally pointless change.",1,bad
I recently got a tablet & have not been able to get back into my Facebook account since then they can't seem to locate my Facebook account that iv had for several years now !!! My Facebook account is VERY IMPORTANT to me it's my whole purpose & iv been trying for several days now to log back into my account but to NO AVAIL !!! FACEBOOK NEEDS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEIR LOYAL Patrons TO retrieve their accounts then for all of those HACKERS & fake profiles that slip by then !!!,1,good
New update always play video on reels. Really sucks because cannot be full screen. Sometimes even different video played. Notification on comments mentioned also did not work as it should.,3,bad
"Gives me an error when I try to click on marketplace links. Also, every time I go into the app, it shuts down forcefully and tells me there is a ""bug"" in the app and I can't use it.",1,bad
This a manipulative unfair platform...it is all about bias and manipulation..it chooses what to share in your timeline no matter what the ethics are about..shame on you.. Also the ad for the wall pilates is so annoying ..I blocked it several times and declared it as unwanted...but still get this stupid ad,1,bad
"A total nuisance and a waste of time. I never asked for any of these ads. Now you want us to purchase a premium version without ads. Love FB, but this is a crock of manure. Still useless.",1,bad
"Too many unwanted adverts and too many lies about why I see them it is an invasion of my privacy as I have got all my information private if I wanted to buy any of this rubbish I would get it from a physical shop, even when I complain I still get this intrusion on my privacy",1,bad
"Ever since I have been using Facebook, I have been following a lot of national and international news, or not only this, I have also found Facebook to be a good platform for earning money. I have also been trying to use Facebook. you Facebook very good app thank you 💝",5,good
I don't understand how I am restricted from posting anything for 3 days when I haven't been on Facebook to post anything!! If I do it's only to say Happy Birthday to people or the little games they have on there 😡 Saying I posted something out of context about somebody is very irritating especially when I see all these other posts from people that shouldn't be allowed at all!! Get it together faacebook!! This is the reason people are going to other social medias!!,1,bad
"After my latest update, I've been unable to schedule posts on my Facebook. Scheduling posts make my profile active even when I'm not online. But now, I'm regretting updating my Facebook app😒🥲",1,bad
I just want to delete my account n there's not an option to be able to do that for some reason and I've tried following the steps it says thru settings but my app is missing the security and step I guess how lame 🙄 Facebook has gotten so out of control with the hacking and scammers it's basically pointless to have it in my opinion and why I'm trying so hard to delete it but can't ughhhhh,1,bad
"Same complaints as the other Android users about the comment section jumps. Way too many ""recommended"" posts - so many so that I no longer see much of my friends' posts. Can't put the posts in chronological order any longer, so I am seeing weeks old posts mixed in with just posted, or missing many from close friends because of so many ad posts.",1,bad
"It's ridiculous how hard you're making it to sign in in a new device with codes, backup codes, texts, and God knows what other weird non sense pass codes. And if only, OMG if only at least one of them worked. Why making it this hard? What happened to the good old password?? I was not using Facebook much and for many times thought about closing my account. I guess this is it. Congratulations! You get yourself one less person and a bad review. Well done you 👍",1,bad
"The watch area is buggy. After a while, i can't watch videos unless it's on the front watch page. which gets annoying because i see a video I'minterestedin and i can't watch it because there is no play button or i can't zoom it to full screen please fix it. The marketplace is buggy, too .",3,bad
Some videos play sound some don't. Ads are ridiculous. I dont see my friends as much as I see other pages with memes or sayings. Only gives me a select few friends to see on news feed. And this blocking comments cause they might be offensive... is total bs! Bunch of softies!,2,bad
"Account hasn't updated since 8/8/23 . Constant screen issues, sharing and like keys as well, won't run smoothly EVER. QUALITY HAS GONE TO HELL SINCE META WAS EMBELLISHED IN IT.

"This app are the real useless. Cannot even do a simple thing as posting a real good video, either it goes black or freeze, if it's about Palestine and Israel, I'm not include on those while my account seems Glitching out due to their system confusing to block people. Suggesting that this app will never recover their rating forever.",1,bad
9/23: marketplace and news disappeared from navigation bar. Opening links externally doesn't work You can't unpin Video. I get that Facebook wants to compete with TikTok but respect users. So sick of Facebook shoving features down our throats - now defaulting to Reels of random people i am not Friends with. Stories was annoying but reels of random people is just downright gross.,1,bad
"suddenly i cant access everything, like my voice turns mute and i cant reach others as well ... please be fair... you are the face... the apps gets so complicated and unfriendly...",1,bad
"Fix the issues! It takes 4-5x of clicking to get out of a comment section of a post which is really annoying! Also, there's more repetitive ads than there is content.",1,good
"A lot of censorship that is purely based on biases and blind algorithm. There's too much clunk when it comes to moving around in the app. FB has gone from bad to worse in a record time! Did I mention the lack of the freedom of expression and banning links in Canada? Oh yeah, it sucks!",1,bad
"This application should no longer be in the Playstore, because the application is becoming more and more unclear, just lots of advertisements and buying and selling",1,bad
This app is literally unusable. Upon opening I just get nothing but loading circles. I help mod a community on FB and it's just such a pain without a working mobile app.,1,bad
Ever since my phone updated this morning the app will not open at all. Just stays on the loading screen. I've deleted and reinstalled several times to no avail. I'd give negative stars if I could.,1,bad

"How do u guys keep breaking sharing posts and reels to Messenger, then try open the post, it doesn't work. Is it that some devices don't work the same as others. It was working before an update. It's just getting annoying now.",1,bad

"Thanks Facebook for fixing all bug fixes, now everything is back to normal, also if you can add thumb and add title name button for every video that we upload that will be great......",5,bad
"Sorry but Facebook dating sucks yal make it so difficult for me to find love saying I match up with 300 different girls in the past two years and only ended up with to scammers and the other 2 I ended with they were removed so I can't talk to them probably because I'm some Reason not allowed to talk to them on messenger and Instagram, very dumb rules it's America land of the free we should have the freedom to talk to who ever and where ever we want.",3,bad
"Facebook is still really screwed up. Plus you can't comment on a public post without a fake, spam, scam account replying. Facebook needs just to revamp the whole program to fix the problems. Stop adding new features and fix the problems.",1,bad
"When you divided messenger and Facebook into separate apps it ruined it. Also full of scam ads every few inches of scrolling. Put your 'fact checkers' to work filtering false ads instead of political propaganda campaigns. I want to see all my friend's feeds (not just fav 10 or 15) instead of suggesting which paid pages to follow. Get it together Facebook, you've become a trashy app",1,bad
After the most recent update the app keeps saying there was an error logging in and it forces me to log out and log back in again but the problem is it only happens if I switch between apps for example If I go to YouTube and back to Facebook or go to Snapchat and back to Facebook I immediately get logged out soon as I begin to scroll again please fix this why is it doing this anyway it never did this before the recent update,1,bad
The back button is broke from this last update. Only does it once clicked on a notification. Pretty annoying tbh. Galaxy S10+,2,bad

"The sudden restriction of accounts for about 24 hours without any reason is horrible. I was just scrolling down through my news feed and reacting to those random posts without leaving any comments, and then suddenly being restricted for about 24 hours without any reason. How is your service like that? This is unforgivable! This happens to me many times, and I just disregard it, but now it's getting out of hand. Please fix this kind of problem.",1,bad
"Now, this app has taken control over some of your phone features, it completely disabled the phones back button, forcing you to use Facistbooks back arrow function, also Facistbook has turned into a liberal machine, deleting and censoring conservative posts, and if you continue to post conservative posts, you'll be banned for 30 day stretches! ... So it would be best, of you go and find a social media platform, that remembers that it's only a platform, and should not care, what your beliefs are!",1,bad

I think there should be a way to talk to someone live especially when you have millions of people using Facebook I have had a couple accounts took from me because of scams and could have received them if someone would have been able to prove it was me instead of going through automated because some information is hard to remember so it seems it's not you but if you have your ID and can take a photo love of yourself then they would know and be able to help you much faster and easier,3,neutral

"in my opinion, has become a cause for concern. The platform's insatiable appetite for personal data and its consistent disregard for user privacy is deeply troubling.

If you are somehow wilfully unaware, this app is nothing more than an attempt to collect as much information on you so that they can sell it and make money.

If you want to copy other socials at least learn something from them....!!!",1,bad
When scrolling on Facebook you usually swipe up so that you can go down to read more posts. For some reason the developers made it so when you touch the screen it automatically Scrolls up in the wrong direction so that's you're fighting yourself and you can't scroll down to see the next post!

It's an absolutely terrible buggy experience. There are so many issues that have been present for ages. As far as I'm aware only one of the tens of issues I've encountered has been properly addressed.

And that's not even touching on the many privacy concerns. Don't even get me started.,1,bad

Like many, I use my tablet in landscape mode, and when I switch to Facebook, it opens up sideways: in portrait mode, making it all but unusable unless I detatch the keyboard and use the tablet in portrait mode, which means effectively I can't use the keyboard in Facebook.

Has Facebook ever considered under report profile had a report as hacked option that limits messaging and commenting on people's profiles so the hackers cannot continue changing information and reaching out to the persons friends list until the owner can regain access to their profile again?

Bad algorithm. It Has no freedom of speak. Facebook is a very toxic place. It shuts down all accounts that speak against their opinions and prevents anyone from having a different voice than theirs. And i have not mentioned in either the market place or the unwanted ads.,1,bad

I personally liked this app before but now ads are interrupting the videos very often which is very annoying... Secondly it's not the safe app anymore because data you shared with facebook is not confidential any more.... And the most important one is this app is supporting Israel #terrorist country without taking into the account either it is a Conflict or a Zionist plan in the favor of genocide...Israel's are oppressors so 1 star is more than enough for this app,1,bad
Extremely difficult to log in on new phone. Does not accept any google authenticator codes. Sent in ID and log in info doesn't work either. Beyond frustrating and ridiculous,1,bad

For the past few weeks there was a clear bias in seeing some posts and some decreased reach for selected topics. This is a good app only if you don't care about credibility and transparency.,1,neutral

Oh well, I'm sure life without Facebook for a while will be better.",2,bad
All around bad. Posts are fed to you by algorithm in an attempt to keep you hooked. The algorithm is a whole topic that's the subject of constant research because Facebook corporate is secretive and malicious. You can't just set the main feed to see what your friends are posting. You have to use a special tab that doesn't have all the other navigation and messenger tools on the sides. It's always pushing videos and posts from people I've never heard of. Steer clear.,1,bad

I would like to see some additions to the Emoji Reactions. I've appreciated the Meta Business avenue still learning.... But several glitches. My music options for reels...

I can only enlarge my photo. Often I want to include more in the view point. Ok u guys are still pretty awesome.so have a good and awesome day. Ok bye.,3,neutral
"Just an embarrassingly bad application, irredeemably poor user experience. Not intuitive at all, constant issues with commenting and notifications, constant issues using marketplace to list items.

Suddenly after a few minutes a ton of the share pop ups come up and interrupt whatever I went to do cause it wasn't working. Then theirs times I'll watch a video and it stops after a few seconds and skips to next even if it's minutes long. If you open a group chat it takes forever to start it and them all get a message. If you post a post it'll sometimes post and other times make you do it again. Worthless.,1,bad
The past few weeks I haven't been getting notifications for my friends birthdays and now I'm not getting notifications for events I'm invited to unless I happen to scroll through the feed and seem someone leave a comment in the event.

There's frequently problems with the check-in page coming up now when clicking the 3 dots on the right of the page the option to suggest edits and check-in is constantly not opening up. Why?

"The page feed for new page experience has stopped loading for a few weeks now. Says all caught up every time. Personal profile feed is fine. No acknowledgement, no response to reports. I need this feature to be functional to be effective.",1,bad
"Notification are garbage, when you click on the notification it will bring you to your page but not to the post, then you can search for the post...... The notifications are a needed but a large waste of my time because for some reason they are not linked with the actual post. When i want to see a specific post that is on my notifications, I should NOT have to search after clicking on it, it should take me to the post that was on my notification....",1,bad
"You made you wrost and bad decision in earlier🤧 you add some new feature like reel, thats your bad decision ever. We don't like it, plz give a option to hide that one, i want to hide reels from facebook because their is some sexual & bad content. Their is no good content and other, most irritating is that reel is in stories place, when ever i open facebook, i always see some bad content. Plz hide it or give option.",1,bad
"Ever since [edit: 3 updates ago],none of the posted video links in my feed have worked. I can still watch the Reels videos or go to the video section and watch those, but not posted ones. Kind of wish there was a way to uninstall updates, but I haven't seen that option in the Playstore for a while.",1,bad
"When someone is sending me request to like their page, I am not able to like the page. When I click on like, it displays something went wrong. Kindly rectify it at your earliest. Since few months I am not getting birthday notifications. Kindly check it out and rectify it.",2,bad
"The app keeps prompting that I've been logged out and that I need to sign in again. So I just close the mobile app and reopen but it shouldn't do that. Also, the hide ad function isn't working. If I select to hide a specific ad, next thing I see is the same exact ad.",1,bad
"I've been using Facebook since Sept. '07, and I'd honestly say it keeps getting worse. I HATE that when I'm scrolling, ever third or fourth person/band/team I follow is an ad. Most of the time, it's a scam. It would be awesome if I could stop seeing all ads.",3,bad
Notifications are inaccurate. The amount of ads are unreal. Dating used to be good bur now you get a random chosen time to send what seems like 10 likes a day when its supposed to be 100. After countless attempts to contact facebook and emails sent to support with nothing back I'm giving up. Shame used to be superior.,1,bad
Suggested text for comments and replies is the worst garbage ever. The app isn't optimized to allow you to actually turn off features(like text prediction built into Facebook app) that you don't want. Since you cannot deactivate these features they will always eat memory for no good reason.,1,bad
"I'm tired of the problems of this app. Now the thing is so damn slow, especially when playing video or worse is playing reel, it takes forever to play. I thought it was my connection but when I switch to Twitter everything works just fine. Swear this is the last time I'm updating this app. If it's still buggy then am uninstalling it for good. Twitter n IG are much better",1,bad
"The letters in the marketplace disappeared, I tried to uninstall the app and install it again, but still not fixed, do a better job programmers, and debuggers, it's been so long but it's still not fixed, don't add new features if you can't even fix the bugs in old ones",1,bad
"Push notification doesn't work. I have to manually keep opening and closing the app throughout the day to check if there is any new notif. The notification list itself is all over the place. Its not sorted by oldest to latest or in any way.

"Not all of the app is available which is terrible. Like dating, it's available in the US, but not open to everyone to use even if you used it before. Then you have other parts like the ads that blanket your facebook with unwanted junk that ruins the whole experience.",2,bad
"Never thought I'd write a review for FB, but here we are. It's just gotten worse and worse over the years, to the point where 80% of my time spent catching up on friends and family ends up being spent trying to hide and ignore suggested pages that I don't follow and never searched for. There's 0 moderation on behalf of the company, so you will get random adult content show up on meme pages. I disabled all of this long ago, many times since 2008. It just keeps resetting each update. Shameless.",1,bad
Your recent updates do not give users who rely on mobile data the ability to click and watch videos that appear on their news feed. They have to change their settings to autoplay on mobile data before they can watch such videos. This experience consumes mobile data. Please fix this by restoring it to the old way.,2,bad
"Jumping to comments, in which one was mentioned/liked, from notifications, are not working properly many times.Very anoying.Also it jumps away when you go back from some open item so you loose where you been.Wouldn expect such unpleasant begaviour from such famous app. Custom folders under ""save video"" are not sorted - very hard to search.If I try create a new folderwhile saving video and folder with such name exists it reads ""already exists"" and noting happens..should save item under instead.",1,bad
"What's the point of getting feedback and do nothing about it? Is there an echo chamber in the office? Facebook feed has been filled with posts that are days if not weeks old that still make it to the top, while recent posts are buried under. On top of that, you see 'group' posts more than post from your friends (if they even appear). FB used to have ways you can filter latest post, but that was removed very quickly. Shouldn't fix things that aren't broken, now the cycle keeps going.",2,bad
I literally can't even use the app anymore it won't let me delete it to re-download it. I've disabled and enabled it back still nothing. I haven't been able to get into Facebook unless I use the website in over a month and half the time the website crashes the moment I try to do anything other than scroll the feed.,1,bad
"The latest updates have been horrible. I don't get notifications for 2-48 hours, if at all! I don't see all events, missed a graduation party because it never showed up on events! Half the time, I only find out someone commented because I go to my post and check.",2,bad
"I've just installed this on my new phone and can't get past the log-in screen. The keyboard won't appear as I try to sign in. No way of bringing this up.

"On my main page, I can only see my past 3 posts, kept saying ""something went wrong, please check your connection and try again"". I tried clearing caches and even reinstalled FB app at least three times. Reported the issue twice to FB, no response but things resume normal for a day but back to the same problem again. Reported the third time, no response and just realised a few minutes ago that there is an update, did it but no help, still only see past 3 posts. Web version is fine.",1,bad

"The app is good yes, but I've encountered a lot of problems with my account and it seems it was hacked. Unfortunately my I couldn't retrieve it since the email suddenly became different. Hope Facebook can strengthen its security but overall it's good",3,neutral
Experience has totally been ruined with trying to add on too many features that just end up being spammy.. @everyone and being invited to group chats constantly from pages and groups you're a part of have ruined it. Really considering giving up with FB these days as now is just annoying. Even with turning some of the options/notifications off you constantly have to be doing this or doing it to lots of different groups seperately as you keep trying to add new ideas that just totally suck tbh.,1,bad
Having best time pass from when i startes using Facebook. I have only one main struggle with Facebook watch because the timeline of the video is so difficult to adjust. Some times if its a big video I can't rewind to 0.00 to watch again. The timeline is so edged to left to right. Pls make a adjustment for thia timeline to better user experience,3,neutral
"Very bad!!! I have had no notifications for 3 weeks now. Many crashes and slow uploads when sharing videos! They offer No remedies, acknowledgements, and solutions to many of the issues I mentioned above. The fiesty Fact checkers are constantly on harassment mode . The continuous censorship , restrictions, montly jailing, bottom lower feeds, and shadowbanning never stops!",1,bad
"A lot of issues reported, none of them fixed. I don't like that it takes so much storage. Also, I hate all those ads. I would rather pay a little money but have no trackers from Facebook - apart from other issues It also slows down my device.",1,bad
"This is app crash every time, every update comes with a new problem before i couldn't see more than 6 ads on market place now i can't set anything on filter can't even scroll for more options to find out relevant ads on market place. I've tried to reset the app and even tried to reinstall it again.",1,bad
"More issues!! Apparently the ""log out"" fails to log you out. upon logging back in, it does not ask for a password. 😐 I have tried force stop and disable app, but it still will not log me out completely. It is integrated into my phone, so I have no uninstall option.",1,bad
"Why can I not longer adjust the audience for an individual post. I don't want to make it my default audience. I just want this one post to not go to certain people. I used to be able to do that, but now when I try, the app melts down and kicks me out. Y'all really need to quit playing politics and go back to just running a successful app. This is ridiculous.",2,bad
"Some non-friend profiles don't load properly. The pfp and cover photo are smaller, and they don't load when tapped, although it all works fine in Chrome. Seems to affect my phone, but not my wife's phone. Thanks if you take time to look into this issue with latest update.",2,neutral
"Unable to add photos to albums now. Uploading a photo to an album with a friend-list doesn't work anymore. When uploading a photo to an album It asks me if I want to change the audience, and then when I am forced to choose my personalised friendlist, it shares the photo randomly and not on the album selected.",2,bad
"I love using Reels, but the only issue is that if I share Reels from my business page to my personal profile, people who follow my personal profile won't be able to see the original text description of my Reel, which is strange. I have to copy-paste the description onto my share, but viewers cannot watch the video while reading my descriptions, which I often use as music/short-story combinations for a full experience. Aspect ratio changes to a weird size whence you press on a Reel I share, too.",3,good
"Not only has Facebook itself been trash lately because it won't show me people's posts, my posts when people comment things, any worthwhile notifications, or other people's stuff after I've engaged with it, AND nothing but ads every other post. On top of that messenger has not been showing me messages. It will ping my phone but nothing will load, I have no idea who sent me what or even if they sent any. When I open the app it's dialup Internet slow and won't show me new messages. Not worth it.",1,bad
"I've had Facebook and it's partnered company Instagram for years. Recently people I care to share things with say that I don't show up in their timelines and feeds anymore. I get much less interaction than before. The lack of likes doesn't bother me, but if I use social media to share my life with loved ones around the country, and they still don't see it, it kind of defeats the purpose of me using the app at all 🤷 I see way more suggested posts I don't want than posts from small friends list",2,bad
"I've had to delete and reinstall like 8 times within the past 2 days. Very disappointed considering I have my business account. I download it, worka fine but as soon as I exit, and when I try to go into it, it kicks me out and gives me an error.",1,bad
"Not like it use to be. Super slow, videos rarely play. I've followed all of FB suggestions to improve this app, but it still sucks. I've reported my issues many many times, and I get zero response, and nothing improves. Very disappointing!",1,bad
"I have had an active account since 2007. As of 2 weeks ago the app or system allowed a random email to add itself to my account. The random account has changed my password and backups. The fine people at FB have done nothing in assistinge I. Retrieving Amy of my info, contacts or personal photos. This platform has become utter trash",1,bad
"Mostly used for family and marketplace, but marketplace since the new update is wacky. I cant scroll down on the filter screen unless I uninstall and reinstall EVERY TIME I WANT TO USE IT. But all of the filters on the screen currently i am able to click on but scrolling just closes it. It makes finding specific cars annoying as i cant sort by mileage or transmission type which are 2 I use to narrow down my search. Not sure why it happens and nothin online is helpful other than uninstall method",3,bad
"Who hasn't heard of Facebook? They have the worst ads by far. They almost always bring me here trying to exit out of them. That's by design. Awful practices. I will never use this app because of how awful the ads are. No, clicking near the x in the top right corner doesn't mean I want to download this app. The worst part is that it's automatically on my phone and I never wanted it. I'm disappointed in all Facebook employees. Do better and stop annoying us all. EDIT: HERE AGAIN BY PRESSING X-6th",1,bad
"Home page full of tons of irrelevant ads, irrelevant negative toxic pages while updates from friends are nowhere to be found. I spent most of the time removing those irrelevant posts or telling fb to block them or unfollow the pages that I don't even folllow!!! And there those thinngs just keep showing up!!! So frustrating and waste of time. The only reason I keep this app is to find my friends through the search function while there is currently no replacement for this social network platform.",1,bad
"This is the most god awful app I've ever used. The UI is absolute dogwater, nesting menus in menus in menus. The marketplace is literally unusable, because the filters only filter by category(the filters for price and location simply don't work). The moderation by the facebook staff is not great either.",1,bad
"Excellent app.Now Facebook team has added playback speed on video's.But,I realised there is no playback speed option on those videos which was living.As most of the live videos are too long,so it would be more easy for us if there would also be a playback speed option.So I have request to the Facebook team to add playback speed option after live video has finished.",4,good

"Dear Facebook Team, Your security system by mistake block my like option. If i like anyone, I can't like them. It is much more important for a Facebook user to use it.

Crash's. There is a log when you add a listing to marketplace it will not let you select what category therefore you cannot actually make a posting. I have updated my app uninstalled reinstalled re-updated to get the update restarted by phone etc. Trillion-dollar company still has bugs like that is just silly.. I have a Samsung z fold in Facebook is absolutely unusable with this phone It always goes to multiple window that isn't sized correct and to exit multi window it goes back to the homepage,1,bad

But still, FB is fun.",4,good

I've noticed that from my phone it won't let me upload video or more than one photo in a post lately, so I'll install the app to do this, then I'll remove once I do so. If I used fb more, I'd probably keep the app- I just try to keep my phone storage as slim as possible",3,neutral

It is really hard to just create an account for my child. It keeps on looping back to the sign in page. Loading option keeps on just circling around and did nothing. This shouldn't be difficult.

"If you don't have family members or have any reason to use marketplace, dont bother. Every app steals your data, but at least with instagram I actually enjoy using it. The app is slow, impractical, and unenjoyable. It's like the engineers work harder ever day to make this app worse and worse. I happily await the day marketplace is replaced.

And I've triple checked my wifi. I don't have anything blocking Facebook so this is on you. And I thought updating the app would fix this but now almost nothing loads until I switch to using data.

I don't know why sometimes if someone replies to your comment you can't see the comment of you view it. It rather takes you to the post or a different comment. It is disgusting. You should work on it. I've updated the app severally but it's still the same. Edit: I just updated the app again. I went back to view a replied comment and it worked. I don't know if it has been fixed. Will update again.,5,bad
Facebook wants all your information so they can show you more accurate advertising so you purchase more things. They are actively making algorithms that are more and more addictive to users. Not only this but the app itself is so clunky and needs pretty much all your information to even run on your phone. I can't believe I'm downloading this to just share what I think is an altruistic video. Hopefully we all gravitate away from these parasitic apps to less addictive and destructive versions.,1,bad

Well to be honest. There's way too much hacking going on. They send you a notification about someone you're not connected to commented which is absolutely pointless. Escorts can post their services. You have no free speech but women can post provocative videos and pictures of themselves wearing see through clothing. You can report it and that doesn't go against community standards.

I recently made a new account to communicate to people directly who can't be reached via phone. Facebook sure has fallen far from the old Facebook that I remember.

"Facebook's algorithm squashes many of my posts - try sharing anything from another platform like YouTube and you'll never get visibility. Content moderation has an incredibly obvious right-wing bias. My feed is full of random posts from pages and groups that have no relevance to me, instead of posts from family and friends. It's really time to ditch this garbage.",1,bad
It doesn't allow me to log into my Facebook account. It only allows me occasionally. Very poor performance tho,1,bad

It's being worse than ever day by day. Since I'm using Facebook lately in my android phone it has some bugs and glitches but it's still usable but in my android tablet this app is just like hell even it has no build in dark mode also it shows the feed like it's a tiny phone. True that this app is not controllable by It's developers then how could the users of it can have a good experience? It's been a popular app worldwide then why it's getting worse I should be more responsive and reliable.,1,bad

Be a wise person choice yourself the right app. We don't have to travel oversea to see and to know other country way of life. Facebook will accommodae,5,good
"Too many crashes, adds, malware, scams and too much attempted censorship. You say anything that doesn't adhere to their ""ideals""....immediate restrictions,shadowbanning, and a notable drop in app/device performance. Crashes so much and uses so much system resources that my device is constantly trying to put it in deep sleep and treat it as malware...on multiple devices/manufacturers. Overall performance is subpar....and the amount of overreach by Facebook makes the app truly laughable. GARBAGE!!",1,bad
"I spend a lot of time clearing all the ""people I might know"" adds, hundreds of them, and also lost most of the people I actually knew. Very annoying. Rate the add? It's a pretty good add.

Don't you even test B4 applying?😡",1,bad

I could be waiting for the kettle etc., or playing FIFA and its half time. EVERYTIME I open the app, it auto-refreshes and goes back to the top of my news feed resulting in me missing out on content.  The second issue I have is also with the auto-refresh feature. I start reading an article. I do something else for 5 minutes and come back to either finish the article or maybe leave a comment/share the post. But AGAIN the auto-refresh kicks in and the article is lost forever.  The third issue is when watching videos. The facebook video feature is pointless and now means I have to click in the video 3 or 4 times to pause it.",1,bad

"Full of bugs. When you want to change the profile video, it often happens that it doesn't update and gets stuck with the old one. And in the browser version, both videos dissapear. That's without mentioning that repositioning is nearly impossible with the round frame, it doesn't let the photo fit right. Customization in that sense needed - we should be able to choose if we want a square frame because it causes less problems, too. But yeah, remember the video part, please.",1,bad
"Not working after update! The app takes so many attempts just to get on, only to kick you off after a random number of actions. Notifications take ages to come through, and if you've already had the loading screen when trying to get on the app, even clicking on the notification doesn't do anything other than clear it from my phone. None of this was ever an issue before the recent update! I tried using factory settings for the app/reinstalling it but I can't use it unless it adds the update!",1,bad
"Glitchy app, I've recently moved to Android from iOS and the app often crashes, videos do not play correctly and sometimes make the app crash, you click on a notification, the app opens and yes, you guessed it, the app crashes.

"The new video playback makes the video too dark and very annoying. You can't see the title unless you tap the video and you can't read the subtitles because of the darkened area. Why don't you just put back the old video playback with the 5 second skip and rewind feature. Ever since the ""drag and hold"" update for the video playback, my viewing experience has gone down in the dumps! Can't even start at the beginning of the video because of limited screen access.",1,bad
I have no idea why as I haven't had any issues until recently. All the games on the Facebook app have stopped working/won't load at all. And I have repeat issues when trying to upload video posts in which the video playback is laggy or at time the sound goes out of sync. Hopefully this can be fixed soon as I use Facebook to stay in contact and share photos and video with friends and family back home.,2,bad
"The last update broke the cell phone app! The last 3 days when I click on the pictures that someone has included with their original post, in order to see them larger, the page that appears where the larger picture should be is a blank grey. I have no problem clicking on a picture in the comments section to view it larger. This is unique to pictures, that are included with an original post. Facebook on my desktop works absolutely fine.

"Does not allow any freedom. Auto refreshes the whole time normally when you are busy reading an interesting piece of information. Took up almost 1gB of space. If you clear the caches it is back up to 1gB in no time. In app browser doesn't even have an address bar to copy the address and use your normal browser.

"There are so many issues with the current Facebook app, it's incredibly frustrating. Constant notification problems (repeating seen ones and not showing new ones), intermittent problems with commenting, liking something and it saying 'error' every time for apparently no reason, tapping a photo to view it then the whole app freezes. The list goes on. I really don't want to regret moving to Android, but I never had these problems with the Apple app. Please sort it out!",1,bad
Good app. But recently every video appeared as reel. This is very annoying.,3,neutral
"When this app works great, its fantastic, unfortunately that isnt too often though. For ages there's been an error where if you click on someone's profile, or a page you've liked, it'll show the most recent post and then get stuck loading the rest of it and never completing the load to show you the rest of the content. I have missed many posts from groups I am in, and been limited in content I can view due to this. Very disappointing this hasn't been fixed.",2,bad
"If Im scrolling down through the app and I have to set my phone in stand-by, even for a few minutes, when I go back to the app, it sends me right back to the top. This is really frustrating, no other app does it. Its particularly troubling if Im reading something interesting and have to pause for a sec, when I come back, I have to scroll down until I find it again, if I ever find it. This is unacceptable.",3,bad
"This app often has issues with Marketplace. More often than not, I can only see a cropped version of the first picture. When I tap on it, it won't open it so fullscreen; when I swipe, it won't let me look at other pictures for the ad 👎 I often cannot scroll through my notifications. It will say that I have a new notification but none of if is new. It's a painful process. (Android user).",1,bad
"I swear this app gets worse with every update. For starters, what's the point in having a remove notification option if the notification is still going to there when you go back on?! Same thing with people you may know. Plus the app hogs lots of storage and you can't transfer it to a SD card. I only use this app to keep in touch with people/groups that aren't easily available.",1,bad
"Ok, so what is happening? After the last update sound appears out of nowhere (according to my settings, videos play with no sound, until I decide that I want the sound). Even when scrolling, cannot find the culprit, just know, that most of the time, an annoying screeching voice of Alan Carr appears and I have to literally fully close the app, because that annoying voice will be running in the background. Sort yourselves out guys!",2,neutral
"Before this, the app work fine. I'm not sure since when but the problem keeps coming. First, the notification sometimes doesn't work. You got notified but when you enter the app, you can't find it. Another thing to note, there are always a ton of old notifications that I've already clicked before this but still appear as new. Then, the new news feed algorithm sucks. There's a higher chance to forget an old friend that you rarely interact in FB than a new friend that you just interact.",2,bad
"I used to actually be able to keep touch with friends and family . Now , it's basically all reels and ads , and even when you select the option to "" hide "" them to not see a particular ad anymore , it still pops up . It's getting to the point where I'm about done with facebook . Also , I agree with others that those with auditory issues like me can't see the subtitles on the bottom of videos because of the captions that now hover over it , so that function is basically useless .",1,bad
"This app is pretty annoying with the amount of updates that it has. When I try to trim the music in the reels, there is no button to go next so u can't use the music. Sometimes reels won't let me scroll and will only let me watch the one that I clicked on. K came here to see if I had to update it and surprise, surprise, I can't update it. The one time where it actually needs to be updated. Typing won't work sometimes, and it gets annoying. Other than that, everything's pretty decent.",2,neutral
"Terrible. Even when you set the feed to ""most recent"", you get stuff there from three or four days ago. When you hide stuff from pages or apps, it still shows up. Every few days it gets infested with ""sponsored posts"" which are completely irrelevant. And most of the time, it's hopelessly unreliable. Almost everything about it is unutterably execrable.",1,bad
"Notifications are showing up for ones I've already seen. Phone randomly freezes when i select peoples photos. Randomly jumps to top of feed whilst I'm still scrolling down and have to start again. If you miss a random video, there's no way to find it again in your feed. when a friend is mentioned in a comment and you want to try and open it, the comment isn't brought up, it's lost in the abyss of comments.",1,bad
"The app itself keeps getting better and better. It's easy to use and most desktop fucntionality and configurations can be found within the app (if you know where to look). If there's one thing I noticed and perhaps needs more improvement is the app support for desktop like version (e.g. tablets, dex). I noticed that the app is not responsive enough for tablet landscape mode and most of the time I need to switch back to portrait in order to properly use the app. More power, Facebook!",4,neutral
"The application doesn't allow many different very basic features, like simple copy-paste. If you live abroad and doesn't speak well the language, a simple copy paste into a translation app is great, but this doesn't allow you to do that for some stupid reason. Oh but wait, there is an actual translation tool done by Facebook itself! But it doesn't work on all text fields. Great job...",1,neutral
"Nothing seems to work correctly since ""meta"". Posts shown are constantly just 'most relevant' and no ability to see all comments. Everything that used to take one click, now takes three or four clicks to achieve the same thing. When I like or otherwise emoji someone's post, my reaction later disappears. The list goes on and on and on of things that are broken, missing, or worse than they were previously. It's an absolute mess now.",1,bad
"I made an ""upgrade"" from an iPhone 7 to Samsung S10. Previously Facebook was running a bit slow, but just fine. Now the app always stops working, it freezes, the bar moved all the way up so you can't reach it, the post is near to the search form, so if you miss it everyone know what you search. Just awful, I cannot even believe one app can be this bad. Complete junk!",1,bad
"It's a great app but there's a couple issues that have been fairly constant. The first problem is that birthday notifications show up a day early and the second is that old notifications show up as unread at random intervals, even when I clicked on them in an attempt to get rid of them after opening the notification tab which leaves me with 10+ notifications even when I have 0. Other than that it's a solid app that does what it sets out to.",4,good
"The last few updates are a complete disaster. Continuously crashing. I keep having to delete the app and download it again. It will work for 20 minutes, before I have to delete it again. The ""birthday"" feature hasn't worked correctly in months. What a disaster. I rarely use Facebook now, as the user experience is terrible. I think Facebook as a social media app, has sunk to an all time low..",1,bad
New updates aren't working well on my device. Messenger is a mess. It doesn't open new messages. Especially the messenger app for businesses. You can't access your folders to search for specific photos or videos. You are limited by the size of video you can send. You can't copy and paste text from other apps in business messenger and you need to do it all in a tiny little window. The space to type is difficult to navigate in order to correct spelling mistakes of words that have been autocorrected,1,bad
Regular updates that don't actually fix issues. It doesn't matter how many times you report issues as they just get closed. It is impossible to view a status with more than 12 photos. You can swipe through the first 12 but no more than that. This started months ago. This has been reported multiple times over the months. Support tickets just get closed with no action/response!,1,bad
"Watching videos is a pain. The round Pause button keeps showing up and covering part of the screen. Also, the first ad would play at the same time when the video starts playing. I just switched from iPhone to Android. Didn't encounter the same issues from the iPhone Facebook app. Edit: There are just more issues with videos. Now they won't play unless you click and watch the ads.",2,bad
"I don't enjoy it as much as I used to. I'm disappointed with the updating version. The previous feature photos settings was wonderful. But now the feature photos are not showing. I think it should be fixed. Moreover, the story highlights privacy is a complete disaster. I can't change it from public to only friends. This app support violence, being bias to a certain group and restrict access to news, awareness and updates of a group of people that is facing humanity crisis.",1,bad
"There seem to be more and more problems with each release. I keep seeing ""Can't connect"" errors when I'm in the ""most recent"" feed. When scrolling down the feed I randomly get to a point where I just see a dot and can't scroll any further. I randomly get notifications which were things from days ago and have already seen, and finally, the badge icon randomly shows a number of unread notifications (9 most recently), but when I go into the app and check the notifications there is nothing there. It's happening on two different handsets on different networks, so it isn't my phone causing it!",2,bad
"Not the same experience as its with IPhone as its on Android. Certain functions are completely different. And the notifications on Android is annoying as hell! Doesn't change or go away unless you really click them individually. 😡 Edited: Thank you for not making much effort in improving the experience, and that I keep seeing the same old stories on my news feed. It's making it a lot easier to use the app less. Well done! 👍🏻 STOP AUTOMATICALLY FOLLOWING ALBUMS ON MY BEHALF!!!!!",1,bad
"I am extremely disappointed with the Facebook app. It's slow, buggy, and incredibly frustrating to use. The constant updates are irritating and often make the app worse instead of better. The user interface is cluttered and confusing, making it difficult to navigate through the app.Overall, I would not recommend the Facebook app to anyone. There are plenty of better social media apps out there.",1,bad
"well, facebook is actually good, works just as fine to me. I just want to suggest if they fix the process of the app when it's on Landscape(rotated), cause I'm using my tab for social media, and one thing that bothers me is that everytime I share a post, go to my saved posts, or change accounts, it rotates back in portrait mode, and it slows the performance of my tab. I hope you find a way to make this wonderful feature, I know many people wants this feature to be added too. Good luck!",3,good
"Hi Facebook team. I've always loved the app, but in recent times its been uninstalling itself whenever my phone restarts, and in the past week it refuses completely to install on my phone.

Thank you in advance.",1,bad
"Facebook has been bugging me with updates, and now that I'm using the new update, I've noticed that the in-app sound control button has vanished from the Media and Contacts section on Android!!! Why is that the case? Also, Dark Mode does not always appear; I have to close and reopen the app for it to appear. I'd like to make the choice default so that I don't have to activate it every time I reinstall the app. Please correct all of the above issues.",1,bad
"The notifications have been broken for several months now. I get notified for the same things repeatedly - including popups about posts from 3 months ago. The notification tab shows all notifications as being new for the past several months as well. The newsfeed doesn't load more than 20 posts or so and even when I ask to see the most recent (which should be a default choice for the feed like it used to be), it doesn't actually load the most recent. I miss the days when my newsfeed actually showed me things in chronological order.",2,bad

"Stupid thing refresh the feed when the app comes to foreground if it has been in the background. Also you cannot go into a post to read comments because when you press back button to go back to the feed, the whole thing gets refreshed. And this happens almost everywhere when the app switches screens where it has a different layout than the main app screen. This is so annoying and pisses me off almost everytime.

"Rewinding a video is too damn annoying when you just want to watch from the beginning. I can't move the point to 0:00 because of my phone cover. No, the problem isnt me but the dumb user interface designer that thinks that it's a great idea to set the timeline bar that starts literally at the edge of the screen phone and ends at the screen phone. Give us a feature where you double tap the video on the left side which will rewind back to 5seconds earlier and right side to forward. Fix this!",2,bad
"If I could give 0 I would. Since the new update no videos play. The moment I press on a video to play the app closes. Then the Icons at the top keep moving around. Everytime I open the app it's on a different place. Very frustrating. When I press the ""I don't want to see this"" it doesn't disappear. I continuously see the same post over and over just 3 to 4 post down when I scroll. The same adverts even after I blocked them. Very bad since the update.",1,bad
"This app is terrible, and other reviews reflect that. The ""save"" buttons do not function properly, whether it's trying to save a link/post in a specific ""folder"" or trying to save an item in the Marketplace. It is absolutely tedious and makes the overall user experience painful. How these bugs are not fixed quickly is beyond me, but this issue has been ongoing for a while.",1,bad
"Currently Facebook app looks very bad and boring. It used to be fun to watch videos before, but after the current update, there is no forward and backward option, the black screen gives a sense of futility. Problem No. 2 I can't tell you how many times I have uninstalled and installed for this problem. If you go to any page. After viewing a few pictures, if you want to see any middle picture, it starts showing the first picture repeatedly. Fix it fast this problems.",1,bad
Please bring back my photo albums. The tab is gone completely on my own page as well as others. I've reported this before and didn't get feedback. I discontinued as a Beta app holder and it was fixed. After today's update it's back to square one. This is very frustrating as I have many albums saved on my Facebook page and not being able to view any photos.,1,bad
"The app refreshed look is good but plenty of features sink deep within the control panel, untouched, undiscovered. The worst is the Facebook Watch that renders most video at 144p or lower resolution that it's barely watchable. In a split second, you can see the thumbnail of the video in full-res but as soon as you play it, it's mosaiced. There are no option to scale it to, at least, 480p for mobile app but the same video can be viewed in full-res or higher using a mobile browser and load FB in desktop mode. FB, if you have the 'Data Saver' options created, shouldn't you let the downscaling happen when Data Saver is ON?",3,bad
"fb was fabulous until I updated a few days ago. if I want to open a picture, most of the time, all I get is the little timer going round and round and round in the middle of the screen. it also seems slower than before. I have a Samsung 8+ with lots of space in it. I've tried turning phone off, I turned wifi off and restarted and I tried just using mobile data, nothing has improved so I think it has to be the update. please bring back the older version or fix this one and I'll give you full marks",2,bad
"Since a few updates, new notifications arent being shown. I have to open the web page to see them. I've already deleted / reinstalled the app and nothing. Battery and data use are as always not so good, but I don't mind them so much. This notification thing is bothering me soooo much! Other thing is, on iPhone the menu bar (timeline, friends, notifications, etc) appear on the bottom of screen, and on Android at the top... Terrible ergonomics! Bottom is easier to handle",1,bad
"This app, or its companion Messenger, is most certainly recording audio without consent and in the background. It is not an illusion, it isn't psychology. I have seen so many examples where FB will show an advert that is so bang-on strongly tied to what my wife & I were talking about only two minutes before. It is a daily occurrence. I believe one or more of their apps are processing audio in the background, matching key words to display the ads its algorithms consider most relevant.",1,bad
"This app is slow, and the UI is clunky, bloated, and inconsistent. For no reason the editing options for two separate I'm trying to sell are different. Plus trying to get to my items in the marketplace is difficult, being hidden behind two menus. It's not intuitive at all. And there's no option for a chronological view. Why.",1,bad
"I have some annoyances, in that too many irrelevant things are added to the navigation bar, that we cannot control. If users could customize what they see, as well as placement of icons, that would be preferable. Not to mention my notifications is glitched in that it shows ""New"" notifications, on 29/12/18, but all of my more recent notifications are under the earlier tab further down.",3,neutral
"Review: Feb 7, 2022 I just updated this app yesterday and something wrong keeps happening whenever I was videos. 1. Going to WATCH section, I can see the videos play button. Like I need to click on it a couple of times in order to play the video. 2. When the video play for 2 seconds, it restart the video from the beginning. Which is very annoying.",2,bad
"1. Can’t put any languages in Basic Info. I tried adding my lingua franca and English, but the latter always disappears whenever I refresh the page. If I try doing it again, my mother tongue disappears as well. 2. Can’t rewind or fast-forward videos unless you play it on full-screen mode. Sometimes you still can’t do it even when you’re already on full-screen mode, so all you have to do is pan it. 3. When I peruse through someone’s photos, captions take too long to load. Oftentimes not at all.",3,bad
"The app does weird things lately. Started about 2 or 3 updates ago. Shows I have 53 notifications, there's actually none. In posts, it does not show certain comments, there's just a blank spot. Other comments looks greyed out. Note: no datasaver option is on, so can't be due to that. I have screen shots of the problem which I can send you. It's happening to many more people, not just me.",2,bad
"After an update this year the app crashes very often. Some pages or events don't load at all even when i have the fastest Internet connection. And even if they load they mess up the right sequence of the timeline, the pages starts refreshing at its own and loads older posts and you don't even have time to read a single word. The app gets progressively messier with time.",1,bad
"The app works fine. You should seriously consider adding a search button on the timeline as well as in the album section so that we can easily go to a particular album rather than scrolling 100s of albums. Also, while uploading pics from the app, we should be allowed to pick from a particular folder from the phone gallery rather than showing all photos grouped together. Currently it's very difficult to upload very old pics which have reached at the bottom of the pile.",3,neutral
"It's just not working and I can't find help for my issue. I do like the app, normally. But I deleted it and re downloaded it because there was a glitch with opening comments. Well, now I can't log in at all on the app (browser is). I see my correct photo and log in info but no SMS is ever sent, and the ""having trouble"" link is broken. The help section doesn't address my issue. I deleted the app and tried again, without success.",2,bad
"Having moved from iphone to android it is clear what system the developers focus on. super buggy. unresponsive trying to open pictures, clicking the reaction button rarely works, and the iPhone configuration with feed and profile buttons on the bottom of the screen is much more user friendly. lots of catching up to do with IOS which is unfortunate.",1,bad
"The update doesn't help it just makes the app a mess. Whenever I want to share something and send it to someone it doesn't go directly to it and it frustrates me, a lot. The featured photo is not as good as before, i like it better when it's not in a story like feature. In addition, facebook always ruined the quality of the picture I want to upload.",3,bad
"There's always bugs in this app. Most of the time they're minor and not bothersome. I definitely regret updating it though, I was at peace with an old version for several months but after updating it hoping to get newer features and bug fixes I only came across another bug in an area that was perfectly functional. Double tapping a reel to like it doesn't get rid of the like icon in the middle of the screen",3,bad
"it's very klunky for a multi-billion dollar company's app. for example the number of supposably unread messages it shows that you have on Messenger is always wrong. when you click on the Bell and then click on something and read it, when you go back, half the time it doesn't show you that it's been read, they still show as unread. if you're looking at something, go and come back, it's disappeared and you can't find it, you can't delete your own posts, constant bombardment with ads, many more",1,bad
"Facebook is an excellent app to post photos and videos from your gallery, but suddenly with the new update, there's sometimes a common issue. No matter how I try and fix this issue, it always takes on my search. When search something important, it always says ""Could not load results."" and it annoys me every time. At the same time, many people are experiencing the same issue no matter how hard they try, but some lucky people manage to get on with their search. Hope it gets fixed soon!!😅😂🤔",1,good

This app has become the worst app now. If our post is not liked by facebook management team they directly block our account.

I was trying to report a video where someone was cursing and blasphemying (saying G*d* mn), and there was no accurate button to push to report it). Fb concluded that it was not against, ""community standards"" to speak indecently when it would be censored on television.

There are many things bad about this app. First optimization is very poor it keeps running in the background & consuming my data and battery. Second thing is that the UI of Facebook Watch is very poor the quality gets increased automatically to high even if i have enabled data savings mode. I have to reduce the quality for many videos. Third thing is that the app doesn't respond well sometimes clicks doesn't works. These all things are very irritating and needs to be fixed in future updates.,1,bad

I'm not gonna give more than 1 star before you make it possible to let user decide whether they want too see that annoying story section or not. Another bad thing is that all notifications are mixed up with no reason and appear as new no matter how many times you check them.

Facebook's goal is to keep you on the app for longer so you see more ads, but annoying users and hindering them is not the answer! Marketplace messages don't work 100% =lost sales.

Bugs here and there. Can't do simple task without problems. Can't remember when is the last time Facebook apps is flawless. This apps has lost it's identity.
